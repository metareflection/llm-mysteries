Professor Moriarty chose Fastidious Fred Fielder to kill Sherlock Holmes.

Here's why:

The answer lies in the day each man was assigned to watch Holmes.

- Ed the Bludgeoner: Monday
- Herman Houlihan: Tuesday
- Fastidious Fred Fielder: Wednesday
- Morris the Ascot Dandy: Thursday

This is a reference to the story "The Adventure of the Dying Detective," which was published on October 22, 1913. In this story, Holmes has been poisoned

It was very cold day in late December and I was sitting in my office. Detective work can be really tiring sometimes so asked my assistant to get me some coffee. I thought a cup of coffee would be great in this bone chilling day and it will also wash down the tiredness. ''Your coffee is ready.'' said my assistant as she brought in the cup of coffee. Unfortunately, when I had merely taken the first sip, my partner, Jones came in and said ''Put on your jacket Sharmien. We have a mystery in our hands!'' I sighed and put down my cup. Scrap!

I have a feeling I'm missing something obvious.
So, I'm thinking that it's probably not Buchanan, since he's the one that brought them all to Haven in the first place.
I'm also thinking that it's probably not Haven, since he's the detective.
I'm thinking it's not Nader, because he was having a conversation with Buchanan, and probably wouldn't have been able to steal the wallet without Buchanan noticing.

I'm thinking it's not Thomson, because he wouldn't have accused the other three if he was the one who stole the wallet.
So, that leaves Cooper. But, why would he have stolen the wallet and then hid it?
