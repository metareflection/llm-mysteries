Correct answer: B
====ABOUT TO QUERY LLM===
R:  The correct option is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Here's the logic for and against each statement being sufficient:

Statement 1: Cole is under 7 feet tall.

* Sufficient: If Cole is under 7 feet tall, then he must be less than 6 feet tall, as 7 feet is greater than 6 feet. Therefore, this statement alone is sufficient to answer the question.
* Insufficient: However, this statement doesn't directly tell us whether Cole is over 6 feet tall or not. It only tells us that he's under 7 feet tall, which means he could still be anywhere between 5'1" and 6'11".

Statement 2: Every player on Cole's varsity basketball team is above 6'1".

* Sufficient: If every player on Cole's team is above 6'1", then Cole must also be above 6'1", as he's a member of the team. Therefore, this statement alone is sufficient to answer the question.
* Insufficient: However, this statement doesn't tell us anything about Cole's height specifically. It only tells us that the other players on his team are taller than 6'1", but Cole could still be shorter than 6'1" and still be a member of the team.

Taken together, statements 1 and 2 are sufficient to answer the question. If Cole is under 7 feet tall and every player on his team is above 6'1", then he must be between 5'1" and 6'11", which means he's over 6 feet tall. Therefore, option (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient is the correct answer.

Correct answer: C

R:  Option (D) is the correct answer.

Statement 1 alone is not sufficient to determine whether Alice likes elephants more than zebras, as it only tells us that elephants are Alice's favorite animals, but says nothing about her feelings towards zebras.

Statement 2 alone is not sufficient to determine whether Alice likes elephants more than zebras, as it only tells us that zebras are the animals that Alice likes the least, but says nothing about her feelings towards elephants.

However, if we combine both statements, we can conclude that Alice likes elephants more than zebras. This is because if elephants are Alice's favorite animals and zebras are the animals she likes the least, then it follows that Alice likes elephants more than zebras.

Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer, as statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to answer the question.

Here's a breakdown of the logic for and against each statement being sufficient:

* Statement 1 alone:
	+ For: Tells us that elephants are Alice's favorite animals.
	+ Against: Does not provide information about Alice's feelings towards zebras.
* Statement 2 alone:

	+ Against: Does not provide information about Alice's feelings towards elephants.
* Both statements taken together:
	+ For: Provides information about Alice's feelings towards both elephants and zebras.

Correct answer: B
====ABOUT TO QUERY LLM===
R:  The question asks for the number of students in a classroom who wrote an exam.

Statement 1: "Five students failed."

This statement alone is not sufficient to determine the number of students in the classroom. It only provides information about the number of students who failed the exam, but it does not give any information about the total number of students who wrote the exam. Therefore, this statement is insufficient.

Statement 2: "One student was 29th from the top and 16th from the bottom."

This statement alone is sufficient to determine the number of students in the classroom. From this statement, we can infer that the student was 29th from the top and 16th from the bottom, which means there were 29 students above him and 16 students below him. Therefore, the total number of students in the classroom is 29 + 16 = 45.

Therefore, the correct answer is option (B): Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Against option (A): Statement 1 alone is not sufficient because, as mentioned earlier, it only provides information about the number of students who failed the exam and not the total number of students who wrote it.

Against option (C): Either statement 1 or statement 2 alone is not sufficient because statement 1 does not provide enough information, and statement 2 requires additional information to determine the total number of students in the classroom.

Against option (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are not sufficient because statement 1 does not provide enough information, and statement 2 requires additional information to determine the total number of students in the classroom.

Against option (E): Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient. This option is incorrect because statement 2 alone is sufficient, as explained above.

Therefore, the correct option is (B): Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Correct answer: E
====ABOUT TO QUERY LLM===
R:  Option A is the correct answer.

Statement 1 alone is sufficient because it eliminates the possibility of Samuel facing North, which means he must be facing one of the remaining three directions (South, East, or West).

Statement 2 alone is insufficient because it only tells us that Samuel is facing the sun, which could be the case regardless of the direction he is facing. The sun rises in the East and sets in the West, so Samuel could be facing East or West.

Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

Now, let's evaluate the other options:

Option B is incorrect because statement 2 alone does not provide enough information to determine the direction Samuel is facing.

Option C is incorrect because either statement alone does not provide enough information to determine the direction Samuel is facing.

Option D is incorrect because while both statements together provide some information, they still do not pinpoint the exact direction Samuel is facing.

Option E is incorrect because both statements together do provide some information, but they are still not sufficient to determine the exact direction Samuel is facing.

Therefore, option A is the only correct answer.

 Logic:

* Statement 1: Leonid hates vegetables.
If Leonid hates vegetables, it's possible that he doesn't like carrots either. However, it's also possible that he only hates some vegetables, not all vegetables, so statement 1 alone is not sufficient to conclude whether Leonid likes carrots or not.
* Statement 2: Leonid prefers carrots to leeks.
If Leonid prefers carrots to leeks, it means he likes carrots more than leeks. However, it doesn't necessarily mean that he likes carrots overall. It's possible that Leonid hates both carrots and leeks, but prefers carrots marginally more. Therefore, statement 2 alone is also not sufficient to determine Leonid's preference for carrots.

Option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

 Logic:

* Statement 1: Leonid hates vegetables.
As discussed earlier, statement 1 alone is not sufficient to determine Leonid's preference for carrots.
* Statement 2: Leonid prefers carrots to leeks.
If Leonid prefers carrots to leeks, it suggests that he likes carrots. As there is no information to suggest that Leonid hates carrots, we can conclude that he might like carrots. Therefore, statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Option C: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

 Logic:

* Statement 1: Leonid hates vegetables.
As discussed earlier, statement 1 alone is not sufficient to determine Leonid's preference for carrots.
* Statement 2: Leonid prefers carrots to leeks.
If Leonid prefers carrots to leeks, it suggests that he likes carrots. As there is no information to suggest that Leonid hates carrots, we can conclude that he might like carrots. Therefore, either statement 1 or statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

 Logic:

* Statement 1: Leonid hates vegetables.
If Leonid hates vegetables, it's possible that he doesn't like carrots either.
* Statement 2: Leonid prefers carrots to leeks.
If Leonid prefers carrots to leeks, it suggests that he likes carrots.

Together, statements 1 and 2 suggest that Leonid might like carrots, but there's no conclusive evidence to confirm this. Leonid might still hate carrots, but prefer them to leeks. Therefore, statements 1 and 2 taken together are not sufficient to answer the question.

Option E: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

 Logic:

* Statement 1: Leonid hates vegetables.
As discussed earlier, statement 1 alone is not sufficient to determine Leonid's preference for carrots.
* Statement 2: Leonid prefers carrots to leeks.
As discussed earlier, statement 2 alone is sufficient to suggest that Leonid might like carrots.

Therefore, Option E is incorrect.

Conclusion:
The correct answer is Option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

R:  Map:  10%|█         | 7/68 [05:23<54:22, 53.48s/ examples]The question asks for the probability of event B occurring, which can be calculated as:

P(B) = P(A ∪ B) - P(A)

We are given two statements:

Statement 1: Probability of event A is 0.55.
Statement 2: Probability of either A or B or both A and B happening is 0.65.

Now, let's evaluate each statement and determine whether it is sufficient to answer the question:

Statement 1: Probability of event A is 0.55.

This statement provides information about the probability of event A, but it does not provide any information about event B. Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2: Probability of either A or B or both A and B happening is 0.65.

This statement provides information about the probability of either event A or event B or both events happening. Since we want to find the probability of event B, we can use this statement to calculate P(B) as follows:

P(B) = P(A ∪ B) - P(A)
= 0.65 - 0.55
= 0.10

Therefore, statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

Option (A): Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone is insufficient, and statement 2 alone is sufficient.

Option (B): Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

This option is correct. Statement 2 alone provides the required information to calculate P(B), while statement 1 alone does not provide any information about event B.

Option (C): Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone is insufficient, and statement 2 alone is sufficient.

Option (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 does not provide any information about event B, and statement 2 alone is sufficient to calculate P(B).

Option (E): Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 2 alone is sufficient to calculate P(B).

Therefore, the correct option is (B): Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

R:  Map:  12%|█▏        | 8/68 [06:28<57:08, 57.15s/ examples]The question asks whether the building contractor needs a special license. The given statements are:

Statement 1: All buildings with more than 20 floors need a special license.
Statement 2: The building contractor wants to build a 30-storey building.

Now, let's evaluate each option:

Option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Logic for:
Statement 1 provides a general rule that all buildings with more than 20 floors need a special license. If the building contractor wants to build a 30-storey building, which has more than 20 floors, then a special license is required.

Logic against:
Statement 1 doesn't provide any information about the building contractor's specific plan or intention. It only states a general rule, but we need specific information to answer the question.

Option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Logic for:
Statement 2 reveals the building contractor's intention to build a 30-storey building. Since it's a building with more than 20 floors, a special license is required according to statement 1.

Logic against:
Statement 2 doesn't provide any information about the building's height in relation to the requirement for a special license.

Option C: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Logic for:
If we combine statement 1 and statement 2, we can conclusively say that the building contractor needs a special license. Statement 1 provides the general rule, and statement 2 confirms that the building contractor wants to build a building that meets the criterion for needing a special license.

Logic against:
Neither statement alone provides enough information to answer the question. Statement 1 lacks specific information, and statement 2 doesn't provide any information about the license requirement.

Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Logic for:
By combining both statements, we can determine that the building contractor needs a special license. Statement 1 establishes the general rule, and statement 2 confirms that the building contractor's plan meets the criteria for needing a special license.

Logic against:
None.

Option E: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Logic for:
None.

Logic against:
This option is incorrect because we can conclude that the building contractor needs a special license by combining both statements.

Hence, the correct option is (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

====ABOUT TO QUERY LLM===
R:  Map:  13%|█▎        | 9/68 [07:25<56:14, 57.20s/ examples]The question asks how long it would take for 5 brick-laying machines to build a wall that took 10 men 6 hours to build. We need to find the time it would take for the machines to build the wall.

Let's analyze the given statements:

Statement 1: If 5 brick-laying machines work with 5 men, the wall will be built in 7.5 hours.

This statement gives us a direct comparison between the time taken by men and machines. We know that 10 men took 6 hours to build the wall, so if 5 machines and 5 men take 7.5 hours to build the same wall, then the machines alone would take 7.5/2 = 3.75 hours to build the wall.

Statement 2: The brick-laying machines work twice as fast as the men.

This statement gives us a comparison between the speed of men and machines. If the machines work twice as fast as the men, then they would take half the time taken by the men to build the wall. So, if the men took 6 hours, the machines would take 6/2 = 3 hours to build the wall.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

Option (A): Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 does not give us the direct comparison between the time taken by men and machines, and statement 2 alone does not give us the information about the time taken by the machines.

Option (B): Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 2 alone does not give us the information about the time taken by the machines, and statement 1 does not give us the direct comparison between the time taken by men and machines.

Option (C): Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because we need both statements to find the time taken by the machines.

Option (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

This option is correct because together, the two statements give us the information about the time taken by the machines. We can use statement 1 to find the time taken by the machines and statement 2 to determine how fast the machines work relative to the men.

Option (E): Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because we have already determined that statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Therefore, the correct answer is option (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to answer the question.

====ABOUT TO QUERY LLM===
R:  The question asks for the number of people in Ramya's restaurant.

Statement 1: The number of people in Abhinav's restaurant is at least 10 less than the number of people in Ramya's restaurant.

This statement alone is not sufficient to answer the question. It only provides a relative comparison between the number of people in Abhinav's and Ramya's restaurants. It does not provide any information about the actual number of people in Ramya's restaurant.

Statement 2: The sum of the number of people in Ramya's restaurant and Abhinav's restaurant is equal to 70.

This statement alone is sufficient to answer the question. Since the sum of the number of people in both restaurants is equal to 70, we can set up an equation:

Let X be the number of people in Ramya's restaurant.
Let Y be the number of people in Abhinav's restaurant.

According to statement 2, X + Y = 70.

We know that Y is at least 10 less than X (from statement 1). Therefore, Y = X - 10.

Now we have two equations:

1. X + (X - 10) = 70
2. X - 10 + X = 70

Simplifying, we get:

1. 2X = 60
2. X = 30

Therefore, the number of people in Ramya's restaurant is 30.

So, the correct option is (B): Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Let's start by analyzing the statements:

1. Liam takes as much time as Salma and Pranav would take if they worked together.

This statement doesn't give us any information about how long it takes for Liam, Salma, or Pranav to complete the task individually. It only tells us that Liam takes as much time as the combined time taken by Salma and Pranav. Therefore, this statement alone is not sufficient to answer the question.

2. Salma takes double the amount of time that Pranav and Liam take working together.

This statement gives us information about the relative time taken by Salma compared to Pranav and Liam. If we know the time taken by Pranav and Liam, we can deduce the time taken by Salma. Therefore, this statement alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

====ABOUT TO QUERY LLM===
R:  The question is asking when Qi's birthday is.

Statement 1: Tony correctly states that Qi's birthday is after 2nd and before 5th March.

This statement alone is sufficient to narrow down the possible birthdate range to between 3rd to 4th March. Therefore, this statement alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2: Brenna incorrectly states that Qi's birthday is on 3rd March.

This statement alone is insufficient to determine Qi's birthday, as it is incorrect and provides no additional information.

Option (A) is the correct answer, as Statement 1 alone is sufficient, while Statement 2 alone is insufficient.

The logic against option (B) is that Statement 2 is incorrect and provides no valuable information.

The logic against option (C) is that Statement 1 alone is sufficient, and Statement 2 alone is insufficient, so either statement alone is not sufficient.

The logic against option (D) is that both statements together do not provide any additional information, as Statement 1 already narrows down the possible birthdate range, and Statement 2 provides an incorrect specific date.

The logic against option (E) is that Statement 1 alone is sufficient, and Statement 2 alone is insufficient, so it is not the case that neither statement nor both statements together are sufficient.

Therefore, the correct answer is option (A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient to determine Qi's birthday, while Statement 2 is insufficient.

R:  The question asks whether Alexia is a doctor.

Let's evaluate the two statements:

1. Either Alexia or Jenny is a doctor.
This statement does not provide enough information to conclude whether Alexia is a doctor or not. It only tells us that either Alexia or Jenny is a doctor, but we don't know which one. Therefore, Statement 1 alone is insufficient.

2. Alexia and Jenny are a doctor and nurse respectively.
This statement clearly indicates that Alexia is a doctor, as she is paired with the doctor role. Therefore, Statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Now, let's consider the options:

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
This option is incorrect because Statement 1 alone is insufficient, and Statement 2 alone is sufficient.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
This option is correct. Statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question, while Statement 1 alone is insufficient.

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
This option is incorrect because Statement 1 alone is insufficient, and Statement 2 alone is sufficient. We need both statements to conclude that Alexia is a doctor.

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
This option is incorrect because we don't need both statements to conclude that Alexia is a doctor. Statement 2 alone is sufficient.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
This option is incorrect because Statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

R:  The question asks whether there will be more crocodile attacks next year.

Let's evaluate each statement and determine whether it is sufficient to answer the question.

1. Statement 1: There were more crocodile attacks this year than last year.

This statement provides information about the trend of crocodile attacks. If there were more attacks this year than last year, it could suggest that the number of attacks is increasing, which might indicate that there will be more attacks next year. However, this statement alone does not provide enough information to conclude that there will be more attacks next year. Therefore, statement 1 is insufficient to answer the question.

2. Statement 2: 56 people were attacked by crocodiles this year.

This statement provides information about the number of people attacked by crocodiles this year. However, it does not provide any information about the trend of crocodile attacks or whether there will be more attacks next year. Therefore, statement 2 is also insufficient to answer the question.

Now, let's consider both statements together:

When we combine both statements, we can see that there has been an increase in the number of crocodile attacks this year compared to last year (statement 1), and 56 people were attacked by crocodiles this year (statement 2). This information suggests that there has been an increase in the number of attacks, and it is possible that this trend will continue next year. Therefore, statements 1 and 2 taken together provide sufficient information to answer the question, and the correct option is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

In summary, option (D) is the correct answer because both statements provide additional information that, when combined, suggest a trend of increasing crocodile attacks, which might continue next year.

R:  The question asks whether our city has enough beds for patients, and we are given two statements:

1. A city needs at least 100 beds per thousand people.
2. Our city has 150 beds per thousand people.

To determine whether our city has enough beds for patients, we need to evaluate the sufficiency of each statement and their combination.

1. Statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Statement 1 provides a general guideline for the minimum number of beds required per thousand people. However, it doesn't provide any information about the actual number of beds in our city. Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient to answer the question.

2. Statement 2 alone is sufficient.

Statement 2 provides specific information about the number of beds in our city, which is 150 beds per thousand people. This exceeds the minimum requirement of 100 beds per thousand people stated in statement 1. Therefore, statement 2 alone is sufficient to conclude that our city has enough beds for patients.

3. Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Since statement 2 alone is sufficient, it is possible to answer the question with either statement 1 or statement 2. Therefore, option C is incorrect.

4. Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are not sufficient.

Even with both statements, we still don't have enough information to determine whether our city has enough beds for patients. Statement 1 provides a general guideline, while statement 2 provides specific information about our city. However, we need to compare the actual number of beds in our city (150 beds per thousand people) to the minimum requirement (100 beds per thousand people) to determine sufficiency. Therefore, option D is incorrect.

5. Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Therefore, the correct option is B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

In conclusion, statement 2 provides specific information about the number of beds in our city, which exceeds the minimum requirement stated in statement 1. Therefore, we can conclude that our city has enough beds for patients based on statement 2 alone.

R:  The question asks whether circle A is smaller than circle B.

Statement 1: The area of circle B is two times the area of circle A.

* Sufficient: This statement provides information about the relative size of the two circles. If the area of circle B is two times the area of circle A, then circle A must be smaller than circle B. Therefore, this statement alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2: The radius of circle B is less than the radius of circle A.

* Insufficient: This statement only provides information about the radius of the two circles. It does not directly provide information about the size of the circles. Therefore, this statement alone is not sufficient to answer the question.

Statement 1: The area of circle B is two times the area of circle A.

* Sufficient: This statement provides information about the relative size of the two circles. If the area of circle B is two times the area of circle A, then circle A must be smaller than circle B. Therefore, this statement alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2: The radius of circle B is less than the radius of circle A.

Correct answer: F
====ABOUT TO QUERY LLM===
R:  Option (D) is the correct answer.

Statement 1 alone is not sufficient to answer the question because it only allows us to pour water out of the cup, but it doesn't provide any information about the actual amount of water in the cup.

Statement 2 alone is not sufficient to answer the question because it only allows us to measure the height of the water in the cup, but it doesn't provide any information about the actual amount of water in the cup.

However, if we combine both statements, we can answer the question. We can pour water out of the cup into a measuring cylinder or any other container using statement 1, and then measure the height of the water using statement 2. By comparing the height of the water to the height of the cup, we can determine whether the cup is more than half full or at least half empty.

Correct answer: D
====ABOUT TO QUERY LLM===
R:  The question asks whether Bill can afford to buy more $50 pots for his garden, which means we need to know how much money Bill has left in his budget after spending on the 7 plants.

Let's examine each statement and determine whether it is sufficient to answer the question.

Statement 1: Bill's gardening budget is $300 and he has spent some of the budget.

This statement does not provide enough information to determine whether Bill can afford to buy more $50 pots because we don't know how much of the budget has been spent. It's possible that Bill has spent the entire budget on the 7 plants, or that he has spent only a small portion of it. Therefore, Statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Statement 2: Bill has only spent his budget on 7 plants that cost $40 each.

This statement provides more information, but it still doesn't tell us how much of the budget is left. If Bill has only spent $40 per plant, then he has spent a total of $280 ($40 x 7 plants). However, we don't know what other expenses Bill has incurred in his gardening, so we can't assume that he has $20 left in his budget ($300 - $280) to spend on more pots. Therefore, Statement 2 alone is also insufficient.

Now, let's consider both statements together:

Statement 1 and Statement 2 together:

When we combine both statements, we get a clearer picture of Bill's budget. We know that Bill's gardening budget is $300, and he has spent $280 on 7 plants ($40 x 7 plants). This means he has $20 left in his budget ($300 - $280). Since each pot costs $50, Bill can afford to buy 2 more pots ($20 / $50 = 2) with the remaining budget.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Statement 2: Rita is only taller than Kathy and Komal.

* Sufficient: This statement alone is sufficient to determine the third tallest person. From this statement, we can deduce that Rita is taller than Kathy and Komal, which means that the third tallest person is either Rachel or Rahi.

Both statements together:

* Sufficient: Together, the statements provide additional information that helps to confirm the third tallest person. Komal is neither the tallest nor the shortest, which means that the third tallest person cannot be Komal. Additionally, Rita is only taller than Kathy and Komal, which means that the third tallest person must be either Rachel or Rahi.

* Sufficient: Yes, x is divisible by 2. An even number is always divisible by 2.

Statement 2: The square root of x is greater than 4.

* Sufficient: No, the statement does not provide enough information to determine whether x is divisible by 2. The square root of x being greater than 4 only implies that x is a positive number, but it does not guarantee that x is divisible by 2. For example, x could be 5, which is not divisible by 2.

(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

* Correct. Statement 1 alone is sufficient to determine that x is divisible by 2, while statement 2 alone is not sufficient.

(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

* Incorrect. Statement 2 alone is not sufficient to determine whether x is divisible by 2, as explained above.

(C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

* Incorrect. Statement 1 is sufficient, but statement 2 is not sufficient on its own.

(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

* Incorrect. Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are not sufficient to determine whether x is divisible by 2. Even if the square root of x is greater than 4, it does not guarantee that x is divisible by 2.

(E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Statement 1: x is an even number.

* Sufficient: Yes, x is divisible by 2. An even number is always divisible by 2.

Statement 2: The square root of x is greater than 4.

* Sufficient: No, the statement does not provide enough information to determine whether x is divisible by 2. The square root of x being greater than 4 only implies that x is a positive number, but it does not guarantee that x is divisible by 2. For example, x could be 5, which is not divisible by 2.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

* Correct. Statement 1 alone is sufficient to determine that x is divisible by 2, while statement 2 alone is not sufficient.

(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

* Incorrect. Statement 2 alone is not sufficient to determine whether x is divisible by 2, as explained above.

(C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

* Incorrect. Statement 1 is sufficient, but statement 2 is not sufficient on its own.

(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

* Incorrect. Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are not sufficient to determine whether x is divisible by 2. Even if the square root of x is greater than 4, it does not guarantee that x is divisible by 2.

(E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

* Incorrect. Statement 1 alone is sufficient, so this option is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct option is (A), Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

R:  The question asks for the age of Qi, and we are given two statements:

Statement 1: Five years ago, Qi's age was half of her current age.
Statement 2: Qi will be 23 years old in 5 years.

Now, let's analyze each statement and determine whether it is sufficient to answer the question:

Statement 1:

* If Qi's age was half of her current age five years ago, that means her current age is twice the age she was five years ago.
* However, this statement doesn't tell us what Qi's current age is, so it's not sufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2:

* If Qi will be 23 years old in 5 years, that means her current age is 23 - 5 = 18 years old.
* So, this statement is sufficient to answer the question.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

Option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

* We've already determined that statement 1 is not sufficient, so this option is incorrect.

Option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

* We've determined that statement 2 is sufficient, so this option is correct.

Option C: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

* This option is incorrect because statement 1 is not sufficient, and statement 2 is sufficient.

Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

* This option is incorrect because statement 1 doesn't provide enough information to determine Qi's age, and statement 2 alone is sufficient.

Option E: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

* This option is incorrect because statement 2 alone is sufficient.

Therefore, the correct option is B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

R:  Map:  43%|████▎     | 29/68 [22:09<39:55, 61.42s/ examples]The question asks when Tony's birthday is, and we are given two statements that provide information about his birthday.

Statement 1: Natasha correctly states that Tony's birthday is after 16th and before 19th March.

Statement 2: Brenna incorrectly states that Tony's birthday is on 20th March.

Now, let's evaluate each statement individually to determine if they are sufficient to answer the question.

Statement 1:

Logic for sufficiency:

* Natasha's statement provides a range of dates (17th to 18th March) within which Tony's birthday falls.
* This range narrows down the possible dates for Tony's birthday to just two days (17th and 18th March).

Logic against sufficiency:

* Natasha's statement doesn't explicitly mention the exact date of Tony's birthday.
* There could be other people born between 17th and 18th March, so it's not possible to pinpoint Tony's birthday with certainty.

Statement 2:

Logic for sufficiency:

* Brenna's statement mentions a specific date (20th March) for Tony's birthday.
* If Brenna's statement is correct, then Tony's birthday would be on 20th March.

Logic against sufficiency:

* Brenna's statement is incorrect, as stated in the question.
* Tony's birthday cannot be on 20th March, as Brenna claims, since she is wrong.

Now that we have evaluated each statement, let's consider the options:

Option (A): Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Logic for sufficiency:

* Statement 1 provides a range of dates that Tony's birthday falls within.
* Statement 2 is incorrect, so it cannot provide any useful information.

Logic against sufficiency:

* Statement 1 doesn't explicitly mention the exact date of Tony's birthday.
* We need additional information to narrow down the range of possible dates.

Option (B): Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Logic for sufficiency:

* Statement 2 mentions a specific date (20th March) for Tony's birthday.
* If Brenna's statement were correct, Tony's birthday would be on 20th March.

Logic against sufficiency:

* Brenna's statement is incorrect, so we cannot rely on it to determine Tony's birthday.
* Statement 1 doesn't provide enough information to determine Tony's birthday.

Option (C): Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Logic for sufficiency:

* Statement 1 provides a range of dates that Tony's birthday falls within.
* Statement 2 mentions a specific date (20th March) for Tony's birthday.

Logic against sufficiency:

* Statement 1 doesn't explicitly mention the exact date of Tony's birthday.
* Statement 2 is incorrect, so we cannot rely on it to determine Tony's birthday.

Option (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Logic for sufficiency:

* Statement 1 provides a range of dates that Tony's birthday falls within.
* Statement 2 mentions a specific date (20th March) for Tony's birthday.
* Combining both statements allows us to narrow down the possible dates for Tony's birthday to just two days (17th and 18th March).

Logic against sufficiency:

* We still cannot determine Tony's birthday with certainty, as there could be other people born on those two days.

Option (E): Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Logic for insufficiency:

* Statement 1 doesn't explicitly mention the exact date of Tony's birthday.
* Statement 2 is incorrect, so we cannot rely on it to determine Tony's birthday.
* Combining both statements doesn't provide enough information to determine Tony's birthday with certainty.

After evaluating each option, we can conclude that the correct answer is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient. This option provides the most reliable information to determine Tony's birthday, as it narrows down the possible dates to just two days and allows us to eliminate other possible birthdays.

Correct answer: A
====ABOUT TO QUERY LLM===
R:  This is a classic logic puzzle. The correct answer is option (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Here's why:

Statement 1: Each cowshed contains one cow.

This statement alone is not sufficient to answer the question, "How many cows live on the farm?" as it only provides information about the maximum number of cows that could be on the farm (50 cows, one per cowshed). It doesn't provide any information about the actual number of cows.

Statement 2: There are at least 60 cows.

This statement alone is not sufficient to answer the question, "How many cows live on the farm?" as it only provides a lower bound on the number of cows (at least 60). It doesn't provide any information about the actual number of cows.

Taken together, statements 1 and 2 are sufficient to answer the question. We know that each cowshed contains one cow, and there are at least 60 cows. Therefore, the total number of cows on the farm is at least 60, and at most 50 (the number of cowsheds). So, the number of cows on the farm is between 60 and 50, inclusive.

Therefore, the correct answer is option (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Let's examine each statement and determine whether it is sufficient to answer the question.

1. Statement 1: The author of "Under the Sun" only writes adventure books.

This statement is sufficient to answer the question. If the author only writes adventure books, then it is likely that "Under the Sun" is also an adventure book, which means Alina will want to read it.

Correct answer: A
====ABOUT TO QUERY LLM===
R:  Answer: The correct option is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Logic:

Statement 1: Betty answered False.

This statement alone is not sufficient to determine the correct answer, as it only tells us that Betty answered incorrectly. It could be that the correct answer is True or False.

Statement 2: The test has 5 questions.

This statement alone is not sufficient to determine the correct answer, as it only provides information about the number of questions on the test.

When we combine both statements, we can determine the correct answer. If Betty answered False and the test has 5 questions, then the correct answer must be True, as there are only 5 possible answers for a 5-question test, and Betty ruled out one of them by answering False. Therefore, statements 1 and 2 taken together are sufficient to determine the correct answer.

Therefore, the correct option is (D).

Correct answer: D
====ABOUT TO QUERY LLM===
R:  I'll break down the statements and analyze them one by one to determine which option is the correct one.

Statement 1:
The difference in the marks obtained by T and U is eleven. U got the highest marks.

This statement provides us with the following information:

* The difference between T and U's marks is 11.
* U got the highest marks.

From this statement, we can conclude that T's marks are 11 less than U's marks.

Statement 2:
The difference in the marks obtained by S and T is fifteen, and the difference in the marks obtained by U and V is nine.

This statement provides us with the following information:

* The difference between S and T's marks is 15.
* The difference between U and V's marks is 9.

From this statement, we can conclude that S's marks are 15 more than T's marks, and U's marks are 9 more than V's marks.

Now, let's analyze each option:

Option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone does not provide enough information to determine the difference in marks between S and V. We need statement 2 to determine the difference between S and V's marks.

Option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 2 alone does not provide enough information to determine the difference in marks between S and V. We need statement 1 to determine the highest marks, which is necessary to calculate the difference between S and V's marks.

Option C: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because both statements are needed to determine the difference in marks between S and V.

Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

This option is correct. By combining both statements, we can calculate the difference in marks between S and V. We know that S's marks are 15 more than T's marks (from statement 2), and T's marks are 11 less than U's marks (from statement 1). Therefore, S's marks are 15 + 11 = 26 more than U's marks.

Option E: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because we have already proven that combining both statements provides sufficient information to determine the difference in marks between S and V.

Therefore, the correct option is (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

* U got the highest marks.

From this statement, we can conclude that T's marks are 11 less than U's marks.

This statement provides us with the following information:

* The difference between S and T's marks is 15.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone does not provide enough information to determine the difference in marks between S and V. We need statement 2 to determine the difference between S and V's marks.

This option is incorrect because statement 2 alone does not provide enough information to determine the difference in marks between S and V. We need statement 1 to determine the highest marks, which is necessary to calculate the difference between S and V's marks.

Option C: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because both statements are needed to determine the difference in marks between S and V.

Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

This option is correct. By combining both statements, we can calculate the difference in marks between S and V. We know that S's marks are 15 more than T's marks (from statement 2), and T's marks are 11 less than U's marks (from statement 1). Therefore, S's marks are 15 + 11 = 26 more than U's marks.

Option E: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Correct answer: B
====ABOUT TO QUERY LLM===
R:  There are four players in a game of Monopoly: E, F, G, and H. We need to determine who is sitting opposite G.

Statement 1: E is sitting to the right of H.

This statement does not provide any information about G's position. It only tells us that E is sitting to the right of H, but we don'kop't know where G is sitting. Therefore, Statement 1 alone is insufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2: F is sitting opposite to H.

This statement tells us that F is sitting opposite to H. Since there are only four players, we know that the person sitting opposite to H must be G. Therefore, Statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Now, let's consider both statements together:

Statement 1 and Statement 2: E is sitting to the right of H, and F is sitting opposite to H.

We know that F is sitting opposite to H, and E is sitting to the right of H. This means that G must be sitting to the left of H. Therefore, both statements taken together are sufficient to answer the question.

So, the correct option is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Let's summarize the logic:

* Statement 1: Insufficient. Does not provide information about G's position.
* Statement 2: Sufficient. Provides information about F's position, which helps us determine G's position.
* Both statements together: Sufficient. Provides information about F's and E's positions, which helps us determine G's position.

2. There are seven red ants in this room.

Let's analyze each statement and determine which option is the correct one:

Statement 1: Only black ants can be found indoors.

* Sufficient: No, this statement alone is not sufficient to determine the total number of ants in the room. It only tells us that all the ants in the room are black, but it doesn't give us any information about the number of ants.
* Insufficient: Yes, this statement alone is insufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2: There are seven red ants in this room.

* Sufficient: No, this statement alone is not sufficient to determine the total number of ants in the room. It only tells us that there are seven red ants in the room, but it doesn't give us any information about the number of black ants or the total number of ants.
* Insufficient: Yes, this statement alone is insufficient to answer the question.

Now, let's consider the combination of both statements:

* Sufficient: Yes, the combination of both statements is sufficient to answer the question. We know that all the ants in the room are black (statement 1), and we know that there are seven red ants in the room (statement 2). Since all the ants are black, and there are seven red ants, the total number of ants in the room is seven.

Therefore, the correct option is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to answer the question.

Logic for option (A):

* Statement 1 alone is sufficient to determine that all the ants in the room are black, but it doesn't give us any information about the number of ants.
* Statement 2 alone is insufficient to determine the total number of ants in the room, as it only tells us about the number of red ants.
* Together, the statements are sufficient, as we know that all the ants are black and there are seven red ants in the room, which gives us the total number of ants.

Logic for option (B):

* Statement 1 alone is insufficient, as it doesn't give us any information about the number of ants.
* Statement 2 alone is sufficient to determine that there are seven red ants in the room, but it doesn't give us any information about the number of black ants.
* Together, the statements are not sufficient, as we still don't know the total number of ants in the room.

The question asks: "P is towards which direction of Q?"

Statement 1: "Q is to the north of R, who is to the west of P."

This statement provides information about the location of Q relative to R and P. Since R is to the west of P, we know that Q must be to the north of R, which means Q is to the north-west of P.

Therefore, Statement 1 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2: "P is to the north-west of S."

This statement provides information about the location of P relative to S. However, it doesn't provide any information about Q's location. Therefore, Statement 2 alone is insufficient to answer the question.

Now, let's consider the options:

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient. - CORRECT

This is the correct option because Statement 1 alone provides enough information to determine the direction of Q relative to P, while Statement 2 alone does not provide any information about Q's location.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient. - INCORRECT

This option is incorrect because Statement 2 alone does not provide enough information to determine the direction of Q relative to P.

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient. - INCORRECT

This option is incorrect because Statement 1 alone is sufficient, but Statement 2 alone is not sufficient.

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient. - INCORRECT

This option is incorrect because we've already determined that Statement 1 alone is sufficient, and Statement 2 alone is not sufficient. Therefore, combining the two statements doesn't change the fact that only Statement 1 is sufficient.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient. - INCORRECT

This option is incorrect because we've already determined that Statement 1 alone is sufficient.

Therefore, the correct option is (A): Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Correct answer: E
====ABOUT TO QUERY LLM===
R:  Option (D) is the correct answer.

Let's analyze each statement and determine whether it is sufficient to answer the question:

1. Statement 1: "Buses usually depart on time."
This statement does not provide any information about the specific bus schedule or the time of departure for the bus to the airport. Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient to answer the question.
2. Statement 2: "The scheduled arrival is at 11:40 a.m."
This statement provides information about the arrival time of the bus at the airport, but it does not reveal the departure time. Therefore, statement 2 alone is also insufficient to answer the question.

Now, let's consider statements 1 and 2 together:
If we combine statements 1 and 2, we can infer that the bus is likely to depart on time (according to statement 1) and arrive at the airport at 11:40 a.m. (according to statement 2). Therefore, we can deduce that the bus leaves for the airport before 11:40 a.m. However, we still don't know the exact departure time.

Option (D) states that statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to answer the question. This is indeed the case, as we can deduce the departure time of the bus from the combined information. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer.

The other options can be eliminated as follows:

* Option (A): Statement 1 alone is not sufficient to answer the question, as it does not provide any information about the specific bus schedule or departure time.
* Option (B): Statement 2 alone is not sufficient to answer the question, as it only provides information about the arrival time and not the departure time.
* Option (C): Either statement 1 or statement 2 alone is not sufficient to answer the question, as we need both pieces of information to deduce the departure time.
* Option (E): Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together are sufficient to answer the question. This is not true, as we have seen that statements 1 and 2 taken together do provide sufficient information to answer the question.

Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer, as statements 1 and 2 taken together are sufficient to answer the question "What time does the bus leave for the airport today?"

R:  The question asks how many students are sitting in a row facing the board.

Statement 1: Kavya, who is fifth from the left end, is ninth to the left of Aadesh who is seventh from the right end.

* Sufficient: This statement provides the position of Kavya and Aadesh in the row. Kavya is fifth from the left end, and Aadesh is seventh from the right end. Therefore, the number of students sitting in a row facing the board can be calculated by subtracting the distance between Kavya and Aadesh from the total number of students in the row. However, we don's know the total number of students in the row, so this statement alone is not sufficient.

Statement 2: Jagrav is eighth to the right of Neerja, who is sixteenth from the right end and fifth from the left end.

* Sufficient: This statement provides the position of Neerja and Jagrav in the row. Neerja is sixteenth from the right end and fifth from the left end, which means she is ninth from the left end (since the row has 16 students in total). Jagrav is eighth to the right of Neerja, which means he is thirteenth from the left end. Therefore, the number of students sitting in a row facing the board can be calculated by subtracting the distance between Neerja and Jagrav from the total number of students in the row. However, we don't know the total number of students in the row, so this statement alone is not sufficient.

Both statements together:

* Sufficient: Now we have two sets of information. From statement 1, we know that Kavya is fifth from the left end and Aadesh is seventh from the right end. From statement 2, we know that Neerja is ninth from the left end and Jagrav is thirteenth from the left end. We can use the information from statement 1 to find the distance between Kavya and Aadesh and then use the information from statement 2 to find the distance between Neerja and Jagrav. Then, we can subtract the sum of these two distances from the total number of students in the row to find the number of students sitting in a row facing the board.

Therefore, the correct option is (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Logic for statement 1 being sufficient:
Statement 1 tells us that blue is called green, white is called black, and brown is called purple. This means that the words for colours are shifted by one position in the spectrum. Therefore, if we know that a fresh tomato is red, we can determine its colour in the game by shifting the word for red by one position in the spectrum. Since red is called orange in the game, a fresh tomato would be called orange.

Logic against statement 2 being sufficient:
Statement 2 gives us a different set of word changes, where yellow is called white, red is called orange, and green is called brown. This set of changes does not provide enough information to determine the colour of a fresh tomato. We would need to know how the word for red is changed in this game to answer the question.

Option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient, while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Logic for statement 2 being sufficient:
Statement 2 tells us that yellow is called white, red is called orange, and green is called brown. We know that a fresh tomato is red, so we can determine its colour in the game by substituting red with orange. Therefore, a fresh tomato would be called orange in the game.

Logic against statement 1 being sufficient:
Statement 1 does not provide enough information to determine the colour of a fresh tomato. The changes mentioned in statement 1 do not include red, which is the colour of a fresh tomato.

Option C: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Logic for either statement being sufficient:
Both statements 1 and 2 provide information about how colours are changed in the game. Either statement alone can be used to determine the colour of a fresh tomato. If we know that a fresh tomato is red, we can use statement 1 to shift the word for red by one position in the spectrum, making it orange. Alternatively, we can use statement 2 to substitute red with orange, also making a fresh tomato orange.

Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Logic for both statements being sufficient:
When combined, statements 1 and 2 provide a complete picture of how colours are changed in the game. We can use statement 1 to shift the word for red by one position in the spectrum, making it orange. Then, we can use statement 2 to substitute red with orange, confirming that a fresh tomato is indeed orange in the game.

Option E: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Logic against all statements being sufficient:
None of the statements provide enough information to determine the colour of a fresh tomato on their own. Even when combined, statements 1 and 2 do not provide enough information to determine the colour of a fresh tomato, as they only tell us that red is called orange, but not what orange is called.

The correct option is D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Conclusion:
By analyzing each option, we can conclude that option D is the correct answer. Statements 1 and 2 provide enough information when combined to determine the colour of a fresh tomato in the game. The logic against option E being sufficient also supports this conclusion, as none of the statements provide enough information to determine the colour of a fresh tomato on their own.

R:  Option (D) is the correct answer.

Statement 1 alone is not sufficient because it does not provide any information about the volume of the golden globe after drilling. It only tells us that the silver rod is aligned with the vertical axis of the globe, which does not help us determine the volume of the remaining gold.

Statement 2 alone is not sufficient because it only tells us the diameter of the silver rod, not the volume of the golden globe.

However, if we combine both statements, we can calculate the volume of the remaining gold. We know that the silver rod has a diameter of 1.25 cm, and it is perfectly aligned with the vertical axis of the globe. This means that the cross-sectional area of the silver rod is circular with a radius of 0.625 cm (half the diameter).

We also know that a 6 cm long hole is drilled through the center of the golden globe, which means that the volume of the remaining gold is equal to the volume of the sphere minus the volume of the cylinder. The volume of a sphere (V) can be calculated using the formula V = (4/3) \* π \* r^3, where r is the radius of the sphere.

The volume of the cylinder (V) can be calculated using the formula V = π \* r^2 \* h, where r is the radius of the cylinder and h is its height (in this case, 6 cm).

So, the volume of the remaining gold is:
V = (4/3) \* π \* r^3 - π \* r^2 \* h

Now, we can substitute the values:
r = 0.625 cm (since the diameter of the silver rod is 1.25 cm)
h = 6 cm

V = (4/3) \* π \* (0.625)^3 - π \* (0.625)^2 \* 6

V = 20.022 cubic centimeters

Therefore, the remaining volume of the golden globe after drilling is approximately 20.022 cubic centimeters.

So, option (D), which states that statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient, is the correct answer.

Statement 1 alone is not sufficient to answer the question because it only provides information about the number of pages read after lunch on Friday, which does not help in determining the number of pages read on Thursday.

Statement 2 alone is not sufficient to answer the question because it only provides information about the total number of pages in the book and the portion that was read by Wednesday, which does not help in determining the number of pages read on Thursday.

However, when we combine statements 1 and 2, we can find the number of pages read on Thursday. We know that three-fifths of the book was read by Wednesday, and we also know that 54 pages were read after lunch on Friday. Therefore, we can calculate the number of pages read on Thursday by subtracting the number of pages read by Wednesday from the total number of pages in the book and then subtracting the number of pages read after lunch on Friday.

Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. Statement 1: "The last 54 pages were read after lunch on Friday."

Insufficient. This statement only provides information about the number of pages read after lunch on Friday, which does not help in determining the number of pages read on Thursday.

2. Statement 2: "The book has 380 pages out of which three-fifths were read by Wednesday."

Insufficient. This statement only provides information about the total number of pages in the book and the portion that was read by Wednesday, which does not help in determining the number of pages read on Thursday.

3. Combining statements 1 and 2:

We know that three-fifths of the book was read by Wednesday, so let's call the number of pages read by Wednesday "x". We also know that 54 pages were read after lunch on Friday, so let's call the number of pages read on Thursday "y".

We can set up the following equation:

y + x = 380 (total number of pages in the book)

We also know that y = 54 (number of pages read after lunch on Friday)

Therefore, we can solve for x:

x = 380 - 54

x = 326

So, three-fifths of the book, or 326 pages, were read by Wednesday.

Therefore, the number of pages read on Thursday is:

380 - 326 = 54

The answer is 54 pages.

Since we were able to find the answer using both statements, option (D) is the correct answer.

Statement 1 alone is insufficient because it doesn' Definetely tell us the number of girls in the family. It only tells us that the number of girls is twice the number of boys, but we don't know the number of boys.

Statement 2 alone is sufficient because it tells us that the youngest child is a boy, and he has three sisters. This means that, including the youngest child, there are four children in the family, and three of them are girls.

Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer. When we combine both statements, we know that there are four children in the family, three of whom are girls, and we also know that the number of girls is twice the number of boys, which means there is one boy and three girls. 

So Option (D) is Correct.

Logic for statement (1) being insufficient:
If there are 4 children in the family and 2 boys, then the number of girls is still unknown.

Logic for statement (2) being sufficient:
It tells us about the youngest child, and we know that the youngest child is a boy, and he has 3 sisters, So including the youngest child, there are 4 children in the family, and 3 of them are girls.

Logic for statement (1) and (2) taken together being sufficient:

The contestants are forbidden from disclosing the letter in their envelope to anybody else. Each contestant has to determine the chosen word from the list of six.
The announcer asks the Eastern contestant, Durga, whether she can deduce the word.

1. Durga knows the word, and she doesn't hesitate to say so. This means that the word is not "MOSS," "DRAG," "CULT," or "TRIM," because if it were, Durga would not have known it immediately.
2. Lakshmi also knows the word, and she smiles after thinking for a few seconds. This means that the word is not "CHOP," because if it were, Lakshmi would have known it immediately, just like Durga.
3. Saraswati also knows the word, and she nods in agreement. This means that the word is not "GUTS," because if it were, Saraswati would not have known it immediately, as she was not given an envelope with a letter from that word.
4. Meenakshi also knows the word, which means that the word must be "GUTS," because it's the only word that none of the contestants had an envelope with a letter from.

Correct answer: E
====ABOUT TO QUERY LLM===
R:  The question asks which word in the code language means 'leaf'.

Let's evaluate the two given statements:

1. 'apo fu qe nane' means 'mango leaf is long' and 'nane ko' means 'long stick'.
This statement doesn't reveal anything about the word for 'leaf' directly. However, it suggests that 'nane' might mean 'stick', which could potentially be related to 'leaf'. But we can't conclude anything definitive from this statement alone.

2. 'apo qe lans' means 'green mango leaf' and 'ka lans' means 'green book'.
This statement suggests that 'lans' might mean 'leaf', as 'apo qe lans' specifically refers to a 'mango leaf'. Additionally, the fact that 'ka lans' means 'green book' implies that 'lans' could be a generic term for a leaf, regardless of its color or type.

Now, let's consider the options:

(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Since statement 1 doesn't provide any clear information about the word for 'leaf', this option is incorrect.

(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

This option is correct, as statement 2 suggests that 'lans' means 'leaf', which answers the question.

(C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

This option is incorrect, as we've concluded that statement 1 alone is not sufficient.

(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

This option is incorrect, as we've determined that statement 2 alone is sufficient, and adding statement 1 doesn't provide any additional information about the word for 'leaf'.

(E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

This option is incorrect, as we've found that statement 2 alone is sufficient.

Therefore, the correct option is (B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

The logic is as follows:

* Statement 2 reveals that 'lans' means 'leaf', which answers the question.
* Statement 1 doesn't provide any clear information about the word for 'leaf'.
* Therefore, statement 2 alone is sufficient, while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Correct answer: D
====ABOUT TO QUERY LLM===
R:   Answer: The correct option is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Explanation:

1. Statement 1: Jayant's birthday is on an even date of the month.

This statement alone is insufficient to determine the exact date of Jayant's birthday. Itonly narrows down the possible dates to the even dates of the month - 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, 20th, 22nd, 24th, 26th, 28th, and 30th. There are 12 possible dates in December 2012 that satisfy this condition. Therefore, this statement alone is not sufficient.

2. Statement 2: The day of the month on which Jayant was born is a prime number.

This statement alone is also insufficient for the same reason. There are four prime numbers in December 2012 - 3, 11, 17, and 29. Any of these dates could be Jayant's birthday.

Now, let's consider both statements together:

Assume the even dates of December 2012 that are also prime numbers - 2, 10, 18, 26, and 30.

From the first statement, we know Jayant's birthday is on an even date. Therefore, we can eliminate 3, 11, and 17 from the list, as they are odd dates.

From the second statement, we know Jayant's birthday is a prime number. Therefore, we can eliminate 26 and 30, as they are not prime numbers.

Therefore, the only possible date left that satisfies both statements is December 10th, 2012.

Hence, option (D) is the correct answer.

====ABOUT TO QUERY LLM===
R:  Map:  81%|████████  | 55/68 [41:59<10:16, 47.41s/ examples]The question asks for the time taken to fill the tank, which means we need to find the rate at which the pump fills the tank.

Let's analyze the statements:

1. In half an hour, seven-twelfths of the tank is filled.

This statement provides us with a clue about the rate at which the pump fills the tank. If seven-twelfths of the tank is filled in half an hour, then the pump fills 7/12 of the tank in 30 minutes. To find the time taken to fill the entire tank, we need to divide 12 by 7, which gives us 1 1/2 hours.

So, statement 1 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

2. The pump is switched on at 9:00 a.m.

This statement alone does not provide any information about the rate at which the pump fills the tank. It only tells us the time at which the pump was switched on. Without any information about the rate of filling, we cannot determine how long it would take to fill the tank.

So, statement 2 alone is insufficient to answer the question.

Now, let's consider the options:

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

This option is correct because statement 1 provides us with the rate at which the pump fills the tank, which is sufficient to answer the question. Statement 2, on the other hand, does not provide any information about the rate of filling and is therefore insufficient.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 2 does not provide any information about the rate of filling, and therefore, it is not sufficient to answer the question.

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone is sufficient, but statement 2 alone is not sufficient.

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone is sufficient, and statement 2 does not provide any additional information that would make it sufficient.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone is sufficient.

Therefore, the correct option is (A): Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

R:  Map:  82%|████████▏ | 56/68 [43:11<10:57, 54.76s/ examples]The question asks which statement(s) are sufficient to determine the length of the CEO's speech.

Let's evaluate each statement individually:

1. Statement 1: The CEO spoke 30 words per minute.

This statement provides the rate at which the CEO spoke, but it doesn't reveal the total number of words spoken or the duration of the speech. Therefore, Statement 1 alone is insufficient to determine the length of the CEO's speech.

2. Statement 2: Had the CEO spoken 5 fewer words per minute, her speech would have lasted 4 more minutes.

This statement provides additional information about the relationship between the CEO's speaking rate and the duration of the speech. We can infer that the CEO's speech lasted for a certain number of minutes, and if she had spoken 5 fewer words per minute, the speech would have lasted 4 more minutes.

Now, let's consider the options:

(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

We have determined that Statement 1 is insufficient on its own, so this option is incorrect.

(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Statement 2 provides some information about the relationship between the CEO's speaking rate and the duration of the speech. However, we still need to know the total number of words spoken to determine the length of the speech. Therefore, Statement 2 alone is also insufficient.

(C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Since neither Statement 1 nor Statement 2 is sufficient on its own, this option is incorrect.

(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

By combining the two statements, we can determine the length of the CEO's speech:

1. The CEO spoke 30 words per minute.
2. Had the CEO spoken 5 fewer words per minute, her speech would have lasted 4 more minutes.

We can use the first statement to calculate the total number of words spoken:

Total words spoken = Number of minutes spoken x Words per minute
Total words spoken = x x 30

We can use the second statement to calculate the total number of minutes spoken:

Total minutes spoken = Number of words spoken / (Words per minute - 5)
Total minutes spoken = x / (30 - 5)

Now we have two equations and two unknowns:

Total words spoken = x x 30
Total minutes spoken = x / (30 - 5)

Solving for x, we get:

x = Total words spoken / 30
x = Total minutes spoken x (30 - 5)

Therefore, by combining the two statements, we can determine the length of the CEO's speech in terms of the total number of words spoken and the total number of minutes spoken.

(E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

This option is incorrect since we have shown that Statements 1 and 2 taken together are sufficient to determine the length of the CEO's speech.

The correct option is (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

However, when we combine both statements, we can deduce that Devi has only one daughter, Y. This is because X's father has three children, and one of them is X, so the other two must be X's siblings. Since Y is X's sister and daughter of Devi, she must be one of the two siblings. Therefore, the third child of X's father must be either X or Y's sibling, and since Y is already a daughter of Devi, the third child must be X. Therefore, Devi has only one daughter, Y.

So, option (D) is the correct answer, as statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to answer the question.

The question asks who is the tallest among 5 friends - Anjali, Arun, Ritika, Vishwesh, and Kartik. We are given two statements:

1. Anjali is taller than Arun and Kartik.
2. Arun is shorter than Ritika but taller than Vishwesh.

We need to determine which statement(s) are sufficient to answer the question.

Let's analyze each statement.

Statement 1: Anjali is taller than Arun and Kartik.

This statement tells us that Anjali is taller than both Arun and Kartik, but it doesn't provide any information about Ritika and Vishwesh. Therefore, this statement alone is insufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2: Arun is shorter than Ritika but taller than Vishwesh.

This statement tells us that Arun is shorter than Ritika, but taller than Vishwesh. This means that Ritika is taller than Arun and Vishwesh, but we still don't know about Anjali's height relative to Ritika. Therefore, this statement alone is also insufficient to answer the question.

Now, let's consider both statements together.

From statement 1, we know that Anjali is taller than Arun and Kartik.
From statement 2, we know that Ritika is taller than Arun and Vishwesh.

By combining both statements, we can conclude that Anjali is taller than all three friends - Arun, Kartik, and Ritika. Therefore, the tallest person among the five friends is Anjali.

Thus, the correct option is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to answer the question.

Let's summarize the logic:

* Statement 1 alone is insufficient because it doesn't provide enough information about Ritika and Vishwesh.
* Statement 2 alone is insufficient because it doesn't provide enough information about Anjali's height.
* Both statements together provide sufficient information to conclude that Anjali is the tallest among the five friends.

Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer.

In option A, we're told that X's father is married to Z. This implies that X and Y are siblings, as they share a father. Therefore, this statement alone is sufficient to establish a relationship between X and Y.

option B: statement 2 alone is sufficient

In option B, we're told that Y is the daughter of Z, who has a son and daughter. This means that X and Y have the same mother and father, making them siblings. Therefore, this statement alone is sufficient to establish a relationship between X and Y.

option C: either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient

In option C, we're told that either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient to establish the relationship between X and Y. Since we've already determined that both statements are sufficient, this option is correct.

option D: statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient

In option D, we're told that both statements are required to establish the relationship between X and Y. However, we've already determined that either statement alone is sufficient, making this option incorrect.

option E: neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient

In option E, we're told that none of the given statements are sufficient to establish the relationship between X and Y. This is incorrect, as we've already determined that either statement 1 or statement 2 alone is sufficient.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C: either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

The logic behind this answer is that both statement 1 and statement 2 provide sufficient information to establish the relationship between X and Y, so either one of them alone is sufficient. However, statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are not required to establish the relationship, as either one alone is sufficient. Therefore, option D is incorrect.

Correct answer: D
====ABOUT TO QUERY LLM===
R:  Option (D) is the correct answer.

Statement 1 alone is not sufficient to determine who plays cricket because it only tells us that A plays hockey, which means that A cannot play cricket. However, it does not provide any information about the other three people.

Statement 2 alone is not sufficient to determine who plays cricket because it only tells us that C does not play chess or football, which means that C could play cricket or hockey.

However, when we combine both statements, we can conclude that C plays cricket. Here's why:

1. A plays hockey, which means that A cannot play cricket.
2. C does not play chess or football, which means that C can only play cricket or hockey.

Since A cannot play cricket, and C can only play cricket or hockey, it means that C must play cricket. Therefore, the correct answer is option (D), which states that statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to answer the question.

The other options do not provide the required information to determine who plays cricket:

Option (A): Statement 1 alone is not sufficient because it only tells us that A plays hockey.

Option (B): Statement 2 alone is not sufficient because it only tells us that C does not play chess or football, which does not help us determine who plays cricket.

Option (C): Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient, but this is not true because we need both statements to conclude that C plays cricket.

Option (E): Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient, but this is incorrect because we have shown that combining both statements allows us to determine who plays cricket.

Correct answer: B
====ABOUT TO QUERY LLM===
R:  The question asks how much a clock loses in a day. To answer this, we need to know the clock's rate of loss, which is specified in the second statement. Therefore, statement 2 is sufficient to answer the question.

Let's consider each option:

A. Statement 1 alone is sufficient:

No, statement 1 alone is not sufficient because it only tells us the time on the clock, not the rate of loss.

B. Statement 2 alone is sufficient:

Yes, statement 2 alone is sufficient because it indicates that the clock loses 63 minutes every 63 minutes, which means it loses 1 minute per hour.

C. Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient:

No, neither statement 1 nor statement 2 alone is sufficient because statement 1 doesn't provide information about the clock's rate of loss, and statement 2 doesn't provide information about the clock's current time.

D. Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient:

No, taking both statements together is not sufficient because we still don't know the clock's rate of loss. Knowing the time on the clock (statement 1) and the fact that the hour and minute hands coincide every 63 minutes starting at noon (statement 2) doesn't reveal the clock's rate of loss.

E. Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient:

No, this option is incorrect because statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Correct answer: A
====ABOUT TO QUERY LLM===
R:  The question asks how many tabla instructors teach in this city.

Statement 1: "There is one tabla instructor for each of the 52 classes held in this city"

* Sufficient: This statement alone is sufficient to answer the question because it directly states that there is one instructor for each class, therefore, the number of instructors is equal to the number of classes, which is 52.

Statement 2: "Each tabla instructor teaches 5 students"

* Insufficient: This statement alone is insufficient to answer the question because it only provides information about the number of students per instructor, not the total number of instructors.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

* Correct. Statement 1 directly provides the number of instructors (52), while statement 2 does not provide enough information to determine the number of instructors.

(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

* Incorrect. Statement 2 alone is insufficient because it only provides information about the number of students per instructor, not the total number of instructors.

(C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

* Incorrect. Statement 1 is sufficient, but statement 2 is not sufficient on its own.

(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

* Incorrect. While statement 1 provides the number of instructors (52), statement 2 provides additional information about the number of students per instructor (5). However, combining both statements does not provide a unique answer to the question, as the total number of instructors could be 52, 104, 156, etc., depending on the number of students per instructor.

(E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

* Incorrect. Statement 1 is sufficient, so this option is eliminated.

Therefore, the correct answer is option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Correct answer: D
====ABOUT TO QUERY LLM===
R:  The question we'Only asking us to determine which hospital has more male births than female births. The nearby hospital and the far-off hospital are our options.

Statement 1 alone is insufficient:
This statement gives us the overall percentage of male and female births in a given year. It doesn't tell us anything about the distribution of births between the two hospitals, so it's not sufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2 alone is insufficient:
This statement tells us about the size of the maternity wards at the two hospitals. Even if we assume that the nearby hospital has a small maternity ward, it doesn't necessarily mean that it has more male births than female births. Similarly, even if the far-off hospital has a larger maternity ward, it doesn't necessarily mean that it has more female births than male births. Therefore, statement 2 alone is also insufficient.

Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient:
If we combine both statements, we get a partial answer. From statement 1, we know that male births make up 50.9% of all births, while statement 2 tells us that the nearby hospital has a small maternity ward and the far-off hospital has a larger maternity ward. If we assume that the nearby hospital has a small maternity ward with, say, 100 births per year, and the far-off hospital has a larger maternity ward with, say, 500 births per year, then the nearby hospital would have 50.9% of 100 = 50.9 births, while the far-off hospital would have 50.9% of 500 = 254 births. In this scenario, the far-off hospital has more male births than the nearby hospital. However, this is just an example, and we can't assume the exact numbers of births at each hospital. Therefore, either statement 1 or statement 2 alone is not sufficient to answer the question.

Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient:
If we combine both statements, we can calculate the approximate ratio of male to female births at each hospital. We know that the overall ratio of male to female births is 50.9:49.1. If the nearby hospital has a small maternity ward, let's assume it has 100 births per year. Then, the number of male births at the nearby hospital would be 50.9% of 100 = 50.9. The number of female births at the nearby hospital would be 49.1% of 100 = 49.1.

Now, let's assume that the far-off hospital has a larger maternity ward with 500 births per year. The number of male births at the far-off hospital would be 50.9% of 500 = 254. The number of female births at the far-off hospital would be 49.1% of 500 = 246.

Now, we can calculate the ratio of male to female births at each hospital:
Nearby hospital: 50.9/49.1 = 1.03
Far-off hospital: 254/246 = 1.03

Both hospitals have approximately the same ratio of male to female births. Therefore, statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to answer the question, and the correct option is (D).

Correct answer: D
====ABOUT TO QUERY LLM===
R:  Why is the answer D?

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. M is not younger than P and O is older than N.
 fulfilled does not provide information about who between M and P is older, and it does not provide information about who among N and O is younger. As a result, this claim is insufficient on its own.

2. P is older than exactly two friends.
This statement alone does not provide information about who the two friends are. It does not answer the question of how many friends are older than O. As a result, this claim is insufficient on its its own.

Combining Statements 1 and 2:

If M is not younger than P, and P is older than exactly two friends, we can conclude that P is older than M and N. We can also conclude that O is older than N because O is older than N. As a result, there are three friends who are older than O: P, M, and O.

The correct answer is option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

So finally, the answer is D.
Thats why the answer is D.

R:  Map:  99%|█████████▊| 67/68 [50:53<00:42, 42.79s/ examples]Here's a step-by-step analysis of each statement and whether it is sufficient to answer the question:

1. Statement 1: "The rank list ends with rank 56."

This statement does not provide any information about Ravi's rank from the bottom. It only tells us that the rank list ends with rank 56, but we don't know where Ravi fits into that list. Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient to answer the question.

2. Statement 2: "Kumar ranks 10th but is 47th from the bottom."

This statement provides us with two pieces of information: Kumar's rank (10th) and his position from the bottom (47th). Since Ravi is ranked 22nd from the top, we can deduce that Ravi's rank from the bottom would be 47 - 22 = 25. Therefore, statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Now, let's consider the options:

(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

 This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone is insufficient, and statement 2 alone is sufficient.

(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone is insufficient, and statement 2 alone is sufficient.

(C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone is insufficient, and statement 2 alone is sufficient.

(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

This option is incorrect because we can deduce Ravi's rank from the bottom using only statement 2. We don't need statement 1 to answer the question.

(E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Therefore, the correct option is (B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Conclusion:
Statement 2 provides us with the information that Kumar's rank is 10th and his position from the bottom is 47th. Using this information, we can calculate Ravi's rank from the bottom as 47 - 22 = 25. Therefore, statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question, and the correct option is (B).

Correct answer: D
====ABOUT TO QUERY LLM===
R:  option (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Let's analyze each statement and determine whether it's sufficient to answer the question.

1. Neither S nor T pairs with either Q or R.

This statement doesn't provide any information about the pairing of P, Q, R, S, T, and U. It only tells us that S and T don't pair with Q or R, but it doesn't eliminate any possibilities for P, Q, R, S, T, and U to form 3 pairs. Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient.

2. Neither P nor Q pairs with either S or U.

This statement tells us that P and Q don't pair with S or U. Since P doesn't pair with Q or R, it must pair with either S or U. Similarly, Q must pair with either S or U. Therefore, we can conclude that P pairs with S, and Q pairs with U.

Now, let's consider statement 1 again. Since neither S nor T pairs with either Q or R, we can conclude that T pairs with R. Therefore, we have two pairs: P-S and Q-U.

So, taking statement 1 and statement 2 together, we can determine the pairs as follows:

* P-S
* Q-U
* T-R

Therefore, the correct option is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

The logical reasoning is as follows:

* Statement 1: Eliminates the possibility of S and T pairing with Q or R, but doesn't provide any information about P, Q, R, S, T, and U forming 3 pairs.
* Statement 2: Eliminates the possibility of P and Q pairing with S or U, which allows us to conclude that P pairs with S and Q pairs with U.
* Together: Statements 1 and 2 provide enough information to determine the pairs as P-S, Q-U, and T-R.
