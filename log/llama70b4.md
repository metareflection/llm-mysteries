Tor Hansen is the culprit.

The only neighbor who lives close enough is Cheryl Judson. However, Cheryl is a widow who lives alone, and we know that the culprit is a man. So Cheryl is not the culprit.

That leaves Tor Hansen. We know that Tor is a man, and he also lives close enough to Hal's house to walk there.
