[/INST]


Correct answer: B
The question is Whether Cole is over 6 feet tall.

The first statement states that Cole is under 7 feet tall. It does not directly answer if Cole is over 6 feet tall. Therefore, statement 1 alone is Insufficient.

The second statement states that every player on Cole's varsity basketball team is above 6'1". This means that Cole, being a player on the team, is also above 6'1". Therefore, statement 2 alone is sufficient.

Therefore, the answer is option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient, while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Let's analyze each option:

A. Statement 1 alone is sufficient, while statement 2 alone is insufficient:
This option is incorrect because statement 1 does not directly answer whether Cole is over 6 feet tall, and statement 2 does not provide any information about Cole's height.

C. Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient:
This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone is not sufficient, and statement 2 alone is sufficient.

D. Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient:
This option is incorrect because statement 1 does not provide any information about Cole's height, and statement 2 does not mention Cole's height explicitly.

E. Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient:
This option is incorrect because statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient, while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
Option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient, while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Logic:

* Statement 1: "Elephants are Alice's favorite animals." This statement directly indicates that Alice likes elephants more than zebras.
* Statement 2: "Zebras are the animals that Alice likes the least." This statement only tells us that Alice dislikes zebras the most, but it doesn't provide any information about her preference for elephants.

Option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient, while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Logic:

* Statement 1: "Elephants are Alice's favorite animals." This statement doesn't tell us anything about Alice's preference for zebras.
* Statement 2: "Zebras are the animals that Alice likes the least." This statement indicates that Alice dislikes zebras the most, which means she must like elephants more than zebras.

Option C: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Logic:

* Statement 1: "Elephants are Alice's favorite animals." This statement directly indicates that Alice likes elephants more than zebras.
* Statement 2: "Zebras are the animals that Alice likes the least." This statement only tells us that Alice dislikes zebras the most, but it doesn't provide any information about her preference for elephants.

Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Logic:

* Statement 1: "Elephants are Alice's favorite animals." This statement directly indicates that Alice likes elephants more than zebras.
* Statement 2: "Zebras are the animals that Alice likes the least." This statement tells us that Alice dislikes zebras the most, and when combined with statement 1, it indicates that Alice likes elephants more than zebras.

Option E: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Logic:

* Statement 1: "Elephants are Alice's favorite animals." This statement doesn't tell us anything about Alice's preference for zebras.
* Statement 2: "Zebras are the animals that Alice likes the least." This statement only tells us that Alice dislikes zebras the most, but it doesn't provide any information about her preference for elephants.

Conclusion:
The correct option is D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient. When we combine both statements, we can conclude that Alice likes elephants more than zebras.

Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
The question asks for the number of students in a classroom. Let's analyze each statement and determine which option is the correct one.

1. Five students failed.

This statement,alone, is not sufficient to determine the number of students in the classroom. It only tells us that at least five students are in the classroom, but it doesn't provide any information about the total number of students.

Logic against: We don't know the total number of students who took the exam, so we can't determine the number of students in the classroom.

2. One student was 29th from the top and 16th from the bottom.

This statement,alone, is sufficient to determine the number of students in the classroom. Since the student is 29th from the top and 16th from the bottom, we can conclude that there are 29 students in the classroom.

Logic for: We know that the student is 29th from the top and 16th from the bottom, which means there are 29 students in the classroom.

Now, let's consider the options:

(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone is not sufficient to determine the number of students in the classroom.

(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

This option is correct because statement 2 alone is sufficient to determine the number of students in the classroom.

(C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone is not sufficient, and statement 2 alone is sufficient.

(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 doesn't provide any information about the total number of students, and statement 2 alone is sufficient to determine the number of students in the classroom.

(E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 2 alone is sufficient to determine the number of students in the classroom.

Therefore, the correct option is (B): Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
Option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient, while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

 logic for sufficiency of statement 1:
If Samuel is not facing North, then he must be facing one of the other three cardinal directions (South, East, or West). Therefore, statement 1 provides enough information to determine the direction Samuel is facing.

 logic against sufficiency of statement 2:
Statement 2 only tells us that Samuel is facing the sun, but it doesn't necessarily determine the direction he is facing. For example, if the sun is directly overhead, then Samuel could be facing any direction and still be facing the sun. Therefore, statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient, while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

 logic for sufficiency of statement 2:
If Samuel is facing the sun, then he must be facing East (assuming the sun rises in the East and sets in the West). Therefore, statement 2 provides enough information to determine the direction Samuel is facing.

 logic against sufficiency of statement 1:
As mentioned earlier, statement 1 only tells us that Samuel is not facing North, which doesn't provide enough information to determine the direction he is facing.

Option C: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

 logic for sufficiency of either statement:
If we know that Samuel is not facing North (statement 1), then we can infer that he is facing one of the other three cardinal directions (South, East, or West). Alternatively, if we know that Samuel is facing the sun (statement 2), then we can infer that he is facing East (assuming the sun rises in the East and sets in the West). Therefore, either statement provides enough information to determine the direction Samuel is facing.

 Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

 logic for sufficiency of both statements:
If we know that Samuel is not facing North (statement 1) and he is facing the sun (statement 2), then we can infer that he is facing East. Therefore, both statements taken together provide enough information to determine the direction Samuel is facing.

 Option E: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

 logic against sufficiency of none of the statements:
We have already established that statement 1 alone is sufficient, statement 2 alone is sufficient, and both statements taken together are sufficient. Therefore, option E is not viable.

Conclusion:
The correct answer is option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient, while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

[/INST]


Correct answer: B
The question asks whether there are only blue balls in the basket.

Statement 1: There are no red balls in the basket.

Logic for:
If there are no red balls in the basket, then the only balls that could be in the basket are blue, green, and/or yellow. Therefore, if there are no red balls, it's possible that there are only blue balls in the basket.

Logic against:
Even if there are no red balls in the basket, there could still be green or yellow balls present, so we cannot conclude that there are only blue balls.

Statement 2: The smallest ball in the basket is green.

Logic for:
If the smallest ball in the basket is green, then there must be at least one green ball in the basket. If there are no red balls, then the only other option is blue. Therefore, if the smallest ball is green, then there are only blue and green balls in the basket.

Logic against:
Just because the smallest ball is green, it doesn't mean that there are no blue balls in the basket. There could still be blue balls present, even if the smallest ball is green.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone does not provide enough information to determine whether there are only blue balls in the basket. We need more information, such as statement 2, to confirm whether there are indeed only blue balls.

(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 2 alone does not provide enough information to determine whether there are only blue balls in the basket. We need more information, such as statement 1, to confirm whether there are any red balls present.

(C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because neither statement 1 nor statement 2 alone provides enough information to determine whether there are only blue balls in the basket. We need both statements to conclude that there are only blue balls.

(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

This option is correct. Taken together, statements 1 and 2 provide enough information to conclude that there are only blue balls in the basket. If there are no red balls and the smallest ball is green, then there are only blue and green balls in the basket, and since there are no red balls, there must be only blue balls.

(E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because we've already established that statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to determine that there are only blue balls in the basket.

Therefore, the correct option is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

[/INST]


Correct answer: A
Option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

* Logic for statement 1 being sufficient: If Leonid hates vegetables, then it's likely that he doesn't like carrots either, as carrots are a type of vegetable.
* Logic against statement 2 being sufficient: Even if Leonid prefers carrots to leeks, it doesn't necessarily mean that he likes carrots. He might still hate carrots, but just prefer them over leeks.

Option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

* Logic for statement 2 being sufficient: If Leonid prefers carrots to leeks, then it's likely that he has a positive attitude towards carrots.
* Logic against statement 1 being sufficient: Even if Leonid hates vegetables, it doesn't necessarily mean that he hates carrots specifically.

Option C: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

* Logic for statement 1 being sufficient: See logic for option A.
* Logic for statement 2 being sufficient: See logic for option B.
* Logic against either statement being sufficient: If Leonid hates vegetables but prefers carrots to leeks, it's still possible that he doesn't like carrots.

Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

* Logic for option D being sufficient: If Leonid hates vegetables but prefers carrots to leeks, it's likely that he has a positive attitude towards carrots, but still doesn't like vegetables in general.

Option E: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

* Logic against option E being sufficient: See logic for options A, B, C, and D.

Conclusion:
The correct option is D, Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient. This is because together, the two statements provide enough information to infer that Leonid has a positive attitude towards carrots, but still doesn't like vegetables in general.

Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
The question asks for the probability of event B occurring.

Statement 1 says that the probability of event A is 0.55. This information does not directly give us the probability of event B. It only tells us that the probability of event A is 0.55. Therefore, statement 1 is not sufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2 says that the probability of either A or B or both A and B happening is 0.65. This means that the probability of event B is 0.65 - 0.55 (probability of event A) = 0.10. Therefore, statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Therefore, the correct option is (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Now let's evaluate the other options:

Option (A): Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone does not give us the probability of event B, and statement 2 alone is sufficient to give us the probability of event B.

Option (C): Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone is not sufficient, and statement 2 alone is sufficient.

Option (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
This option is incorrect because we can calculate the probability of event B using statement 2 alone, without needing statement 1.

Option (E): Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
This option is incorrect because statement 2 alone is sufficient to give us the probability of event B.

[/INST]


Correct answer: D
The question asks whether the building contractor needs a special license.

Let's analyze the statements:

1. All buildings with more than 20 floors need a special license.

This statement does not provide enough information to determine whether the building contractor needs a special license, as it only specifies a general rule. It does not give any information about the specific building project.

2. The building contractor wants to build a 30-storey building.

This statement provides information about the specific building project. If the building contractor wants to build a 30-storey building, then the building will have more than 20 floors and, therefore, would require a special license according to statement 1.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

A. Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

This is incorrect because statement 1 does not provide enough information to determine whether the building contractor needs a special license. It only provides a general rule.

B. Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

This is incorrect because statement 2 provides information about the specific building project, but does not provide any information about the licensing requirements for buildings with more than 20 floors.

C. Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

This is incorrect because statement 1 does not provide enough information to determine whether the building contractor needs a special license, and statement 2 does not provide any information about the licensing requirements for buildings with more than 20 floors.

D. Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

This is correct because statement 1 provides the general rule for licensing requirements for buildings with more than 20 floors, and statement 2 provides information about the specific building project. Together, they provide enough information to determine whether the building contractor needs a special license.

E. Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

This is incorrect because statement 1 and statement 2 taken together provide enough information to determine whether the building contractor needs a special license.

Therefore, the correct option is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
The question asks how long it would take for 5 brick-laying machines to build a wall that took 10 men 6 hours to build.

Statement 1 tells us that if 5 brick-laying machines work with 5 men, the wall can be built in 7.5 hours. This statement does not give us direct information about how long it would take for the machines to build the wall alone, so it is not sufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2 tells us that the brick-laying machines work twice as fast as the men. This means that if the men took 6 hours to build the wall, the machines would take 6/2 = 3 hours to build the same wall. This statement is sufficient to answer the question as it gives us the time it would take for the machines to build the wall.

Therefore, the correct option is (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question, while statement 1 alone is not sufficient.

Here's a breakdown of why each statement is sufficient or not sufficient:

* Statement 1: Not sufficient. This statement only tells us how long it would take for 5 brick-laying machines and 5 men to build the wall, but we need to know how long it would take for the machines alone.
* Statement 2: Sufficient. This statement tells us that the brick-laying machines work twice as fast as the men, which means we can calculate how long it would take for the machines to build the wall based on the time it took the men.
* Either statement 1 or statement 2: Not sufficient. While statement 2 alone is sufficient, statement 1 alone is not sufficient. Therefore, this option is incorrect.
* Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together: Not sufficient. We don't need both statements to answer the question, as statement 2 alone is sufficient. Therefore, this option is also incorrect.
* Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient: Incorrect. Statement 2 alone is sufficient, so this option is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct option is (B): Statement 2 alone is sufficient.

Correct answer: E
Memo:

Let X be the number of people in Ramya's restaurant.
Let Y be the number of people in Abhinav's restaurant.

Statement 1:
The number of people in Abhinav's restaurant is at least 10 less than the number of people in Ramya's restaurant.
Y ≤ X - 10

Statement 2:
The sum of the number of people in Ramya's restaurant and Abhinav's restaurant is equal to 70.
X + Y = 70

Option A:
Statement 1 alone is sufficient, as it gives an upper bound for X (X ≤ 70 - 10) and a lower bound for Y (Y ≥ X - 10). Therefore, X can be calculated.

Option B:
Statement 2 alone is insufficient, as it doesn't provide any information about the individual number of people in either restaurant.

Option C:
Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
Statement 1 gives an upper bound for X and a lower bound for Y, while statement 2 gives a fixed value for the sum of X and Y.
Together, they form a system of equations:
X + Y = 70
Y ≤ X - 10
This system is solvable, so either statement alone is sufficient.

Option D:
Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
The same reasoning as option C applies.

Option E:
Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
This option is incorrect, as we've established that either statement 1 or statement 2 alone is sufficient, and taking them together makes the system solvable.

The question asks for the number of boys in a family with 7 children.

Statement 1: "There are fewer girls than boys."

* Sufficient: This statement alone is sufficient to answer the question because it directly tells us that there are more boys than girls. The number of boys is greater than the number of girls, and we can conclude that there are at least 4 boys (since there are 7 children in total).
* Insufficient: However, we cannot determine the exact number of boys without additional information.

Statement 2: "Each girl has half as many sisters as brothers."

* Insufficient: This statement alone is insufficient to answer the question because it does not provide direct information about the number of boys. It only tells us that the number of girls is half the number of boys, but we don't know the total number of boys.
* Sufficient: However, if we combine this statement with statement 1, we can conclude that there are at least 4 boys and at most 3 girls. Therefore, the number of boys is at least 4 and at most 7, and we can answer the question.

Therefore, the correct option is (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Here's a summary of why each option is incorrect:

(A): Statement 1 alone is not sufficient because it doesn't tell us the exact number of boys.
(B): Statement 2 alone is not sufficient because it doesn't provide direct information about the number of boys.
(C): Either statement 1 or statement 2 alone is not sufficient because statement 1 doesn't provide enough information, and statement 2 requires additional information from statement 1 to be sufficient.
(E): Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient, which is incorrect because we've shown that statements 1 and 2 taken together are sufficient.

[/INST]


Correct answer: D
The question is asking when Qi's birthday is.

Statement 1: Tony correctly states that Qi's birthday is after 2nd and before 5th March.

* Sufficient: No, this statement alone is not sufficient to determine Qi's birthday. It only provides a range of dates (March 3-4) but doesn't pinpoint a specific date.

Statement 2: Brenna incorrectly states that Qi's birthday is on 3rd March.

* Sufficient: No, this statement alone is not sufficient to determine Qi's birthday. It provides a specific date (March 3), but since Brenna is incorrect, it's not reliable information.

Now, let's consider the options:

(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

* False. Statement 1 doesn't provide a specific date, so it's not sufficient on its own.

(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

* False. Statement 2 is incorrect, so it's not sufficient on its own.

(C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

* False. We've already determined that both statements 1 and 2 are insufficient on their own.

(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

* True. Combining the two statements, we can narrow down the possible dates for Qi's birthday to March 3-4. Although we can't pinpoint a specific date, we have a smaller range of possible dates.

(E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

* False. We've already determined that statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient, so this option is incorrect.

The correct answer is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Therefore, the answer is option D.

The question asks whether Alexia is a doctor. The given statements are:

1. Either Alexia or Jenny is a doctor.
2. Alexia and Jenny are a doctor and nurse respectively.

Let's analyze each statement and determine which option is the correct one.

Statement 1: Either Alexia or Jenny is a doctor.

* Sufficient: This statement alone is sufficient to answer the question. If either Alexia or Jenny is a doctor, then Alexia could be a doctor.
* Insufficient: This statement alone is insufficient to answer the question. It doesn't explicitly mention Alexia being a doctor.

Statement 2: Alexia and Jenny are a doctor and nurse respectively.

* Sufficient: This statement alone is sufficient to answer the question. Since Alexia is a doctor, the statement confirms that Alexia is a doctor.
* Insufficient: This statement alone is insufficient to answer the question. It doesn't mention Jenny's profession, and we need to know whether Jenny is a doctor or not to determine whether Alexia is a doctor.

Now, let's consider the options:

Option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

* Valid: This option is correct. Statement 1 alone is sufficient to answer the question, while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

* Invalid: This option is incorrect. Statement 2 alone is not sufficient to answer the question, as it doesn't mention Jenny's profession.

Option C: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

* Invalid: This option is incorrect. Statement 1 alone is sufficient, but statement 2 alone is not sufficient.

Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

* Invalid: This option is incorrect. Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are not sufficient to answer the question, as we still don't know whether Jenny is a doctor or not.

Option E: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

* Invalid: This option is incorrect. Statement 1 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Therefore, the correct option is A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

[/INST]


Correct answer: E
Any regression, whether up or down, does not always indicate a trend. The increase in the number of attacks this year over last year could just be a one-time occurence. Therefore, statement 1 is insufficient. 

To know whether there will be more crocodile attacks next year, we need to know the factors that led to this year's attacks. Statement 2 does not provide any information regarding this. 

Therefore, statement 2 is also insufficient.

Therefore, the correct option is (E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

This year's increase in crocodile attacks over last year does not necessarily indicate a trend. It could simply be a one-time occurence. More research on the aspects that led to this year's attacks would be required to predict whether or not there will be more crocodile attacks next year.

[/INST]


Correct answer: E

The question asks whether African member states formed the largest regional group in the United Nations in 1999.

Statement 1: The United Nations Secretary General in 1999 was Kofi Annan, a Ghanian.

 Logic for sufficiency: The fact that the Secretary General was from an African country does not necessarily mean that African member states formed the largest regional group. There could have been other regional groups with more member states.

Logic against sufficiency: If the Secretary General was from an African country, it is possible that African member states had a strong representation in the United Nations and possibly formed the largest regional group. However, this is not conclusive.

Statement 2: In 1998, the African regional group received the largest fraction of UN aid.

 Logic for sufficiency: Receiving the largest fraction of UN aid indicates that the African regional group had a significant number of member states. It is likely that these member states were also part of the largest regional group in the United Nations in 1999.

Logic against sufficiency: The fact that the African regional group received the largest fraction of UN aid does not necessarily mean that they formed the largest regional group. Other regional groups could have had more member states.

Analysis of the options:

Option (A): Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone is not sufficient to answer the question. While the fact that the Secretary General was from an African country may suggest a strong African presence in the United Nations, it does not conclusively prove that African member states formed the largest regional group.

Option (B): Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 2 alone is not sufficient to answer the question. Receiving the largest fraction of UN aid does not necessarily mean that the African regional group had the most member states.

Option (C): Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because neither statement 1 nor statement 2 is sufficient on its own to answer the question.

Option (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

This option is correct. Taken together, the two statements suggest a strong African presence in the United Nations. The fact that the Secretary General was from an African country and the African regional group received the largest fraction of UN aid suggests that African member states had a significant presence in the United Nations and possibly formed the largest regional group.

Option (E): Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because, as explained above, statement 1 and statement 2 taken together provide sufficient information to answer the question.

Conclusion: The correct answer is option (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to answer the question.

Correct answer: A
The question asks us to determine the value of x.

Statement 1: x = 3

This statement alone is sufficient to answer the question, as it directly provides the value of x as 3. Therefore, option A is correct.

Statement 2: x = x

This statement is redundant and does not provide any new information about the value of x. It simply states that x is equal to itself, which is a tautology. Therefore, this statement alone is not sufficient to answer the question.

Therefore, the correct option is (A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

[/INST]


Correct answer: D
The question asks whether our city has enough beds for patients, and we are given two statements:

Statement 1: A city needs at least 100 beds per thousand people.
Statement 2: Our city has 150 beds per thousand people.

Now, let's evaluate each statement and determine which option is the correct one.

Option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Logic for:
Statement 1 provides a general guideline for the minimum number of beds required per thousand people. If our city has fewer beds than this guideline, then it is clear that we do not have enough beds for patients.

Logic against:
Statement 2 provides specific information about our city's bed capacity, which is higher than the guideline given in statement 1. Therefore, statement 1 alone is not sufficient to determine whether our city has enough beds for patients.

Option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Logic for:
Statement 2 provides specific information about our city's bed capacity, which tells us that we have more beds per thousand people than the guideline given in statement 1. Therefore, we can conclude that our city has enough beds for patients.

Logic against:
Statement 1 provides a general guideline, but it does not take into account specific circumstances such as population density, demographics, or healthcare infrastructure. Therefore, statement 2 alone is not sufficient to determine whether our city has enough beds for patients.

Option C: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Logic for:
Either statement 1 or statement 2 provides useful information about bed capacity. If statement 1 is true, then our city needs at least 100 beds per thousand people, and if statement 2 is true, then our city has 150 beds per thousand people. Therefore, either statement can help us determine whether our city has enough beds for patients.

Logic against:
Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 provides complete information about our city's bed capacity. Statement 1 is a general guideline, while statement 2 provides specific information. Therefore, either statement alone may not be sufficient to determine whether our city has enough beds for patients.

Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Logic for:
When we consider both statements together, we get a complete picture of our city's bed capacity. Statement 1 provides a general guideline, while statement 2 provides specific information about our city's bed capacity. By combining both statements, we can determine whether our city has enough beds for patients.

Logic against:
None.

Option E: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Logic for:
None.

Logic against:
Both statements provide useful information about bed capacity, and when taken together, they provide a complete picture of our city's bed capacity. Therefore, option E is not viable.

Conclusion:
The correct option is D. Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to determine whether our city has enough beds for patients. By combining both statements, we get a complete picture of our city's bed capacity and can answer the question.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
The question asks whether Student X passes the test, which requires at least 70% to pass.

Let's evaluate the sufficient options:

(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient:
If Student X got 7 questions correct, and the test has 10 questions, then Student X scored 70%, which meets the passing criteria. Therefore, Statement 1 alone is sufficient to answer that Student X passes the test.

(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient:
If Student X got all the questions correct, then certainly, they passed the test. However, this statement doesn't provide any information about the total number of questions on the test or the required passing percentage. Therefore, Statement 2 alone is insufficient to determine whether Student X passes the test.

(C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient:
If we combine the information from both statements, we know that Student X got 7 questions correct out of 10, which means they scored 70%. This meets the passing criteria, so either statement alone is sufficient to answer that Student X passes the test.

(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient:
Combining both statements, we know that Student X got 7 questions correct out of 10 and got all the questions correct. This means that the test had 10 questions, and Student X scored 100%, which is above the required passing percentage of 70%. Therefore, Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to answer that Student X passes the test.

(E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient:
If we consider both statements together, we still don't know the total number of questions on the test or the required passing percentage. Therefore, Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient to determine whether Student X passes the test.

Therefore, the correct option is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

The logic is as follows:

* Statement 1: 7 questions correct out of 10 = 70%
* Statement 2: All questions correct, but unknown total number of questions and passing percentage.
* Combining Statements 1 and 2: 7 questions correct out of 10, and all questions correct = 100% scored, which meets the passing criteria.

Conclusion:
The correct option is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient. This is because combining the information from both statements provides sufficient information to determine that Student X passes the test with a score of 100%.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
Option (D) is the correct answer.

Explanation:

Statement 1 alone is insufficient to determine whether circle A is smaller than circle B. From statement 1, we know that the area of circle B is twice the area of circle A, but we don't know the actual size of the circles. For example, if circle A has a radius of 1 and circle B has a radius of 2, then the area of circle B is indeed twice that of circle A, but circle B is clearly larger than circle A.

Statement 2 alone is also insufficient to determine whether circle A is smaller than circle B. From statement 2, we know that the radius of circle B is less than the radius of circle A, but we don't know the actual size of the radii. For example, if the radius of circle A is 10 and the radius of circle B is 9, then statement 2 is true, but circle A is still larger than circle B.

However, if we combine statement 1 and statement 2, we can conclude that circle A is indeed smaller than circle B. From statement 1, we know that the area of circle B is twice the area of circle A. From statement 2, we know that the radius of circle B is less than the radius of circle A. Therefore, the radius of circle B must be half the radius of circle A, which means that circle A is twice as large as circle B.

Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer, as statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to determine that circle A is smaller than circle B.

[/INST]


Correct answer: F
Option (D) is the correct answer.

Statement 1 alone is insufficient because it only allows us to pour water out of the cup, but it doesn't help us determine the exact amount of water in the cup.

Statement 2 alone is insufficient because it only allows us to measure the height of the water in the cup, but it doesn't help us determine the exact amount of water in the cup.

Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient because together they allow us to measure the exact amount of water in the cup. With statement 1, we can pour water out of the cup into a measuring cylinder, and with statement 2, we can use a ruler or measuring tape to measure the height of the water in the cup. By combining these two statements, we can calculate the volume of water in the cup.

Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
The question asks whether Bill can afford to buy more $50 pots for his garden. To determine this, we need to know how much money Bill has left in his budget and how much the pots cost.

Statement 1 alone is insufficient because it only tells us that Bill has a budget of $300, but it doesn't tell us how much of that budget has been spent.

Statement 2 alone is insufficient because it only tells us that Bill has spent some of his budget on 7 plants that cost $40 each, but it doesn't tell us how much of the budget is left.

If we combine statements 1 and 2, we can calculate how much of Bill's budget is left. If Bill has spent $40 x 7 = $280 on plants, then he has $300 - $280 = $20 left in his budget. This means he can afford to buy 20 / 50 = 0.4 pots, which is not a whole number, so he cannot afford to buy any more $50 pots.

Therefore, the correct option is (E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Logic for (A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient:
If Bill's gardening budget is $300 and he has spent some of the budget, then we know that he has less than $300 left to spend. If he wants to buy $50 pots, he needs to have enough money left in his budget to cover the cost of the pots. However, statement 1 alone doesn't tell us how much of the budget is left, so we can't determine whether he can afford to buy $50 pots.

Logic for (B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient:
If Bill has only spent his budget on 7 plants that cost $40 each, then we know that he has spent $280 of his $300 budget. This means he has $20 left in his budget, which is not enough to buy even one $50 pot. Therefore, statement 2 alone is sufficient to determine that Bill cannot afford to buy any more $50 pots.

Logic for (C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient:
Statement 1 alone is insufficient because it doesn't tell us how much of the budget is left. Statement 2 alone is sufficient because it tells us how much of the budget has been spent and how much is left. Therefore, either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient to determine whether Bill can afford to buy $50 pots.

Logic for (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient:
If we combine statements 1 and 2, we can calculate how much of Bill's budget is left. If he has spent $280 on plants and has a budget of $300, then he has $20 left in his budget. This means he can afford to buy 20 / 50 = 0.4 pots, which is not a whole number, so he cannot afford to buy any more $50 pots. Therefore, statements 1 and 2 taken together are sufficient to determine whether Bill can afford to buy $50 pots.

Logic for (E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient:
If we combine statements 1 and 2, we can calculate how much of Bill's budget is left. However, we find that he can only afford to buy 0.4 pots, which is not a whole number. This means that he cannot afford to buy any more $50 pots. Therefore, none of the statements alone or taken together is sufficient to determine whether Bill can afford to buy $50 pots.

In conclusion, the correct option is (E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient. This is because we need both statements to calculate how much of Bill's budget is left, but even then, we find that he cannot afford to buy any more $50 pots.

What is the connection between Tim and Justin?

Justin's sister's father's son is Tim. (Assertion 1)
Justin is Tim's brother's father-in-law's only daughter's brother-in-law. (Assertion 2)

Justification for each statement's sufficiency:

1. Statement 1:

Sufficient:

* If Tim is Justin's sister's father's son, then Tim is Justin's brother.
* The relationship between Justin and Tim is established, answering the question.

Insufficient:

* The statement does not establish a direct relationship between Tim and Justin.
* The phrase "sister's father's son" could refer to a cousin or another relative, and without additional information, it's unclear how Tim is related to Justin.
2. Statement 2:

Sufficient:

* If Justin is Tim's brother's father-in-law's only daughter's brother-in-law, then Tim is Justin's brother-in-law.
* The relationship between Justin and Tim is established, answering the question.

Insufficient:

* The statement is quite complex and difficult to decipher, making it hard to determine the exact relationship between Tim and Justin.
* The phrase "brother's father-in-law's only daughter's brother-in-law" could potentially refer to a more distant relative or a relative through marriage, rather than a direct sibling relationship.

Assessing the options:

A. Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

* This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone does not establish a direct relationship between Tim and Justin.

B. Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

* This option is incorrect because statement 2 is too complex and doesn't directly establish the relationship between Tim and Justin.

C. Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

* This option is incorrect because neither statement 1 nor statement 2 alone establishes a direct relationship between Tim and Justin.

D. Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

* This option is incorrect because we cannot combine the two statements to establish a direct relationship between Tim and Justin.

E. Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

* This option is correct, as neither statement 1 nor statement 2 alone establishes a direct relationship between Tim and Justin, and combining them doesn't help clarify the relationship.

Conclusion:
The correct option is E: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The given statements lack direct evidence to establish a clear relationship between Tim and Justin. Therefore, we cannot determine their relationship based on the provided information.

[/INST]


Correct answer: A
The question asks whether x is a prime number.

Statement 1: "x is divisible by the factors of 10."

* Sufficient: No, this statement alone is not sufficient to determine whether x is a prime number. Being divisible by the factors of 10 does not necessarily mean that x is not prime, as 10 itself is divisible by 2 and 5, which are prime numbers.
* Insufficient: Yes, this statement alone is insufficient to determine whether x is a prime number.

Statement 2: "x is greater than 13."

* Sufficient: Yes, this statement alone is sufficient to determine that x is not a prime number. This is because the only prime number greater than 13 is 17, and x cannot be 17 since it is divisible by the factors of 10.
* Sufficient: No, this statement alone is not sufficient to determine whether x is a prime number. There are many numbers greater than 13 that are not prime, such as 14, 16, 18, 20, etc.

Now, let's consider the options:

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone is not sufficient to determine whether x is a prime number.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
This option is incorrect because statement 2 alone is not sufficient to determine whether x is a prime number.

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
This option is incorrect because neither statement 1 nor statement 2 alone is sufficient to determine whether x is a prime number.

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
This option is correct because taken together, statements 1 and 2 can help us determine whether x is a prime number. If x is divisible by the factors of 10 and greater than 13, then it cannot be a prime number.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
This option is incorrect because we have shown that statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to determine whether x is a prime number.

Therefore, the correct option is (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to determine whether x is a prime number.

Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
Option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient, while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Logic for statement 1 being sufficient:
If half the people in the office don't read the newspaper, then the other half must read it. Therefore, we can conclude that at least half of the people in Maria's office read the newspaper.

Logic against statement 2 being sufficient:
10% of the people in Maria's office reading the newspaper doesn't give us enough information to determine the total number of people who read the newspaper. We need more information to calculate the exact number.

Option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient, while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Logic for statement 2 being sufficient:
If 10% of the people in Maria's office read the newspaper, we can calculate the exact number of people who read the newspaper by multiplying the total number of people in the office by 0.10.

Logic against statement 1 being sufficient:
Statement 1 only tells us that half the people in the office don't read the newspaper, but it doesn't give us any information about the remaining half. We need more information to determine the exact number of people who read the newspaper.

Option C: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Logic for statement 1 being sufficient:
Same as above.

Logic for statement 2 being sufficient:
Same as above.

Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Logic for statements 1 and 2 being sufficient:
If half the people in the office don't read the newspaper (statement 1), and 10% of the people in the office read the newspaper (statement 2), we can calculate the total number of people who read the newspaper by subtracting the number of people who don't read the newspaper from the total number of people in the office, and then multiplying the result by 0.10.

Option E: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Logic against statements 1 and 2 being sufficient:
Even if we combine statements 1 and 2, we still don't have enough information to calculate the exact number of people who read the newspaper. We only know that half the people in the office don't read the newspaper, and 10% of the people in the office read the newspaper, but we don't know the total number of people in the office.

Conclusion:
The correct option is D. Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to answer the question of how many people in Maria's office read the newspaper. We can calculate the exact number by subtracting the number of people who don't read the newspaper from the total number of people in the office, and then multiplying the result by 0.10.

1. Komal is neither the tallest nor the shortest. 
2. Rita is only taller than Kathy and Komal.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
Option (D) is the correct answer.

Statement 1 alone is not sufficient as it only eliminates the possibility of Komal being the tallest or the shortest, but it doesn' mudention anything about the relative heights of the other four individuals.

Statement 2 alone is also not sufficient, as it only tells us that Rita is taller than Komal and Kathy but doesn't provide information about the relative heights of Rachel and Rahi.

However, taking both statements together, we can conclude that the third tallest person is Rahi.

Here's a step-by-step logic to prove this:

1. Komal is neither the tallest nor the shortest ( statement 1).
2. Rita is only taller than Kathy and Komal ( statement 2).
3. Therefore, Rita cannot be the third tallest, as she is taller than Komal, who cannot be the third tallest by definition.
4. Thus, the third tallest person must be either Rachel or Rahi.
5. Since Rahi is not the tallest ( statement 1), she must be the third tallest.

So, option (D) is the correct answer, as statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to determine the third tallest person.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
The question asks whether x is divisible by 2.

Statement 1: x is an even number.

* Sufficient: If x is an even number, then it is divisible by 2. Therefore, this statement alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2: The square root of x is greater than 4.

* Insufficient: The square root of x being greater than 4 only implies that x is a positive number, but it does not necessarily mean that x is divisible by 2. For example, the square root of 5 is greater than 4, but 5 is not divisible by 2.

Therefore, the correct option is (A): Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Logic for statement 1 being sufficient:

* If x is an even number, then it can be written as 2n, where n is an integer.
* Therefore, x is divisible by 2.

Logic against statement 2 being sufficient:

* The square root of x being greater than 4 only implies that x is a positive number.
* However, not all positive numbers are divisible by 2.
* For example, the square root of 5 is greater than 4, but 5 is not divisible by 2.

Conclusion:

The correct option is (A): Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient. This is because statement 1 directly implies that x is divisible by 2, while statement 2 only implies that x is a positive number, but not necessarily divisible by 2.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
The question asks for the age of Qi, which means we need to find a specific number that represents Qi's age.

Let's analyze the given statements:

1. Five years ago, Qi's age was half of her current age.

This statement gives us information about Qi's age five years ago, but it doesn't directly tell us her current age. However, we can infer that Qi's age five years ago was half of her current age, so if we can find her current age, we can double it to find her age five years ago.

Is statement 1 alone sufficient to find Qi's current age? No, it's not. We can't determine Qi's current age with this information alone.

2. Qi will be 23 years old in 5 years.

This statement tells us that Qi will be 23 years old in five years. We can infer that Qi's current age is 23 - 5 = 18 years old.

Is statement 2 alone sufficient to find Qi's current age? Yes, it is. We can directly calculate Qi's current age using this information.

Now, let's consider the options:

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

We have determined that statement 1 alone is not sufficient to find Qi's current age, and statement 2 alone is sufficient. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

This option is correct. We have determined that statement 2 alone is sufficient to find Qi's current age, while statement 1 alone is not sufficient.

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

This option is incorrect. We have determined that statement 1 alone is not sufficient, and statement 2 alone is sufficient. Therefore, only statement 2 is sufficient.

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

This option is incorrect. We have determined that statement 1 alone is not sufficient, and statement 2 alone is sufficient. Therefore, taking both statements together does not provide additional information that would make Qi's current age known.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

This option is incorrect. We have determined that statement 2 alone is sufficient to find Qi's current age.

The correct option is (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.

[/INST]


Correct answer: E
The question is asking for the sufficient information to determine Tony's birthday.

Statement 1: Natasha correctly states that Tony's birthday is after 16th and before 19th March.

Logic for sufficiency: This statement provides a range of dates (17th to 18th March) within which Tony's birthday falls. Therefore, it is sufficient to determine Tony's birthday.

Statement 2: Brenna incorrectly states that Tony's birthday is on 20th March.

Logic for insufficiency: This statement provides a specific date (20th March) that does not match the range of dates provided in statement 1. Therefore, it is not sufficient to determine Tony's birthday.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Logic: Statement 1 provides a range of dates, which is sufficient to determine Tony's birthday. Statement 2, on the other hand, provides an incorrect date, making it insufficient. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Logic: This option is incorrect because statement 2 is incorrect and does not provide sufficient information to determine Tony's birthday.

(C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Logic: This option is incorrect because statement 1 is sufficient, while statement 2 is insufficient.

(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Logic: This option is incorrect because statement 2 is incorrect and does not provide sufficient information to determine Tony's birthday, even when combined with statement 1.

(E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Logic: This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone is sufficient to determine Tony's birthday.

Conclusion:
The correct option is (A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
The question is asking for the number of cows on a farm, given the information that there are 50 cowsheds and either statement 1 or statement 2.

Statement 1: Each cowshed contains one cow.

* Sufficient: If each cowshed contains one cow, then the number of cows is equal to the number of cowsheds, which is 50. Therefore, statement 1 alone is sufficient to answer the question.
* Insufficient: Without statement 1, we cannot determine the number of cows based solely on the information that there are 50 cowsheds.

Statement 2: There are at least 60 cows.

* Sufficient: If there are at least 60 cows, then the number of cows is greater than or equal to 60. However, this statement does not provide a precise answer to the question, as it only establishes a lower bound of 60. Therefore, statement 2 alone is insufficient.
* Sufficient: When combined with statement 1, statement 2 becomes sufficient. With statement 1, we know that each cowshed contains one cow, and with statement 2, we know that there are at least 60 cows. Therefore, the total number of cows is at least 60, and since each cowshed contains one cow, the total number of cows is equal to the number of cowsheds, which is 50.

Therefore, the correct option is (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Logic against option (A): Statement 1 alone is sufficient, but it doesn't provide the exact number of cows. Option (A) implies that the number of cows is exactly 50, which is not necessarily true.

Logic against option (B): Statement 2 alone is insufficient, as it only establishes a lower bound of 60 cows.

Logic against option (C): Either statement 1 or statement 2 alone is not sufficient, as statement 1 doesn't provide the exact number of cows, and statement 2 only establishes a lower bound.

Logic against option (E): Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient. This option is incorrect, as we have shown that statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

(F). The question can be answered without either statement.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: F
Option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Statement 1: Saina Nehwal loses the first game.

If Saina Nehwal loses the first game, it means she is behind in the match. However, it doesn't guarantee that she will lose the match. She can still win the second and third games and win the match. Therefore, statement 1 alone is not sufficient to determine the outcome of the match.

Statement 2: P V Sindhu is ranked higher as a badminton player than Saina Nehwal.

If P V Sindhu is ranked higher than Saina Nehwal, it means she has a better skill level and is more likely to win the match. However, it doesn't guarantee that she will win the match. Saina Nehwal may still have a chance to win if she plays well and P V Sindhu has an off-day. Therefore, statement 2 alone is also not sufficient to determine the outcome of the match.

Option C: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

If we combine both statements, we get a clearer picture of the match. If Saina Nehwal loses the first game and P V Sindhu is ranked higher, it suggests that P V Sindhu has a strong advantage in the match. However, it's still possible that Saina Nehwal could win the second and third games and win the match. Therefore, either statement 1 or statement 2 alone is sufficient to determine the outcome of the match, but both statements together provide a stronger indication of the likely outcome.

Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

If we combine both statements, we get a strong indication of the likely outcome of the match. If Saina Nehwal loses the first game and P V Sindhu is ranked higher, it suggests that P V Sindhu has a significant advantage in the match. In this case, it's likely that P V Sindhu will win the match. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.

Option F: The question can be answered without either statement.

It's possible to predict the outcome of the match without knowing either statement. For example, if we know the recent form of both players, their strengths and weaknesses, and their past performances against each other, we can make an educated guess about the outcome of the match. Therefore, option F is not the correct answer.

In conclusion, option D is the correct answer. Both statement 1 and statement 2 taken together provide sufficient information to determine the likely outcome of the match between Saina Nehwal and P V Sindhu.

[/INST]


Correct answer: B
The question asks whether some PQRs are also XYZs.

Statement 1: Some XYZs are ABCs.

This statement does not provide any information about PQRs, so it is not sufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2: Some XYZs are PQRs.

This statement directly addresses the question by stating that some XYZs are also PQRs. Therefore, this statement is sufficient to answer the question.

The correct option is (B): Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Logic for statement 2 being sufficient:

* The statement directly states that some XYZs are PQRs, which means that there exists a subset of XYZs that are also PQRs.
* This subset of XYZs that are also PQRs answers the question of whether some PQRs are also XYZs.

Logic against statement 1 being sufficient:

* Statement 1 only establishes a relationship between XYZs and ABCs, but does not provide any information about PQRs.
* Even if some XYZs are ABCs, it does not mean that some PQRs are also XYZs.

Therefore, the correct option is (B): Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
The question asks whether Alina wants to read "Under the Sun", which can be answered by determining whether the book is an adventure book.

Let's analyze the statements:

1. The author of "Under the Sun" only writes adventure books.

If the author of "Under the Sun" only writes adventure books, then it is likely that "Under the Sun" is an adventure book. However, without further information, it is not certain that Alina wants to read it. Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient.

2. Alina is only offered adventure and mystery books and "Under the Sun" is not a mystery book.

If Alina is only offered adventure and mystery books, and "Under the Sun" is not a mystery book, then it must be an adventure book. This means that Alina may want to read it. However, without knowing Alina's personal preferences, it is not certain that she will want to read it. Therefore, statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Now, let's consider the options:

(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

If statement 1 alone is sufficient, then Alina must want to read "Under the Sun" because the author only writes adventure books. However, this is not the case, as we established that statement 1 is insufficient.

(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

If statement 2 alone is sufficient, then Alina wants to read an adventure book, and "Under the Sun" is an adventure book. Therefore, Alina wants to read "Under the Sun". However, this is also not the case, as we established that statement 2 is insufficient.

(C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because we established that both statements 1 and 2 are insufficient on their own.

(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

This option is correct. When we combine statements 1 and 2, we know that "Under the Sun" is an adventure book written by an author who only writes adventure books. Additionally, Alina wants to read an adventure book. Therefore, Alina wants to read "Under the Sun".

(E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because we established that statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Therefore, the correct option is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Correct answer: A
The question is asking which statement(s) are sufficient to determine the correct answer to a True-or-False test question that Betty answered incorrectly.

Let's evaluate each option:

(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient:

If Betty answered False, then the correct answer is True. Therefore, statement 1 alone is sufficient to determine the correct answer.

(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient:

Knowing that the test has 5 questions does not provide any information about the correct answer to the question Betty answered incorrectly. Therefore, statement 2 alone is insufficient.

(C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient:

Since statement 1 alone is sufficient, this option is incorrect.

(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient:

Combining statements 1 and 2, we know that Betty answered False and the test has 5 questions. However, this doesn't provide enough information to determine the correct answer to the question Betty answered incorrectly. Therefore, this option is also incorrect.

(E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient:

This option is correct because statement 1 alone is sufficient, but statement 2 alone is insufficient, and combining both statements doesn't provide enough information to determine the correct answer.

2. The difference in the marks obtained by S and T is fifteen and the difference in the marks obtained by U and V is nine.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
The question asks for the difference in marks obtained by S and V.

Let's evaluate the statements:

1. The difference in the marks obtained by T and U is eleven. U got the highest marks.

This statement does not provide any information about the marks obtained by S and V. It only gives information about the marks obtained by T and U. Therefore, this statement is not sufficient to answer the question.

2. The difference in the marks obtained by S and T is fifteen, and the difference in the marks obtained by U and V is nine.

This statement provides information about the differences in marks obtained by S and T, and U and V. However, it does not directly provide the difference in marks obtained by S and V. But we can deduce the difference in marks obtained by S and V by subtracting the difference in marks obtained by U and V from the difference in marks obtained by S and T.

Therefore, statement 2 is sufficient to answer the question.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Since statement 1 does not provide any information about the marks obtained by S and V, it is not sufficient to answer the question. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

As discussed, statement 2 provides information that can be used to deduce the difference in marks obtained by S and V. Therefore, this option is correct.

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Since statement 2 is sufficient, this option is incorrect.

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 does not provide any information about the marks obtained by S and V, and statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Therefore, the correct option is (B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
Option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Logic for statement 1 being sufficient:

* If E is sitting to the right of H, then G must be sitting to the left of H.
* Therefore, F must be sitting opposite to H.

Logic against statement 2 being sufficient:

* If F is sitting opposite to H, it doesn't necessarily mean that G is sitting opposite to F.
* There could be another player sitting between F and H.

Option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Logic for statement 2 being sufficient:

* If F is sitting opposite to H, then G must be sitting opposite to F.

Logic against statement 1 being sufficient:

* If E is sitting to the right of H, it doesn't necessarily mean that G is sitting opposite to F.
* There could be another player sitting between E and H.

Option C: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Logic:

* If statement 1 is true, then we know that G is sitting to the left of H, and therefore, statement 2 is also true.
* If statement 2 is true, then we know that F is sitting opposite to H, and therefore, statement 1 is also true.

Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Logic:

* If both statement 1 and statement 2 are true, then we know that G is sitting opposite to F.

Option E: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Logic:

* If statement 1 is false, then we can't determine who is sitting opposite to H.
* If statement 2 is false, then we can't determine who is sitting opposite to F.
* Even if we combine both statements, we still can't determine who is sitting opposite to G.

Conclusion:
The correct option is C. Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Explanation:
Statement 1 alone is not sufficient because it only tells us that G is sitting to the left of H, but it doesn't directly tell us who is sitting opposite to F.
Statement 2 alone is not sufficient because it only tells us that F is sitting opposite to H, but it doesn't directly tell us who is sitting opposite to G.
However, if we combine both statements, we can conclude that G is sitting opposite to F. Therefore, either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
Option D is the correct answer.

Statement 1: R is the niece of P.

This statement does not provide any information about the relationship between R and Q. Therefore, Statement 1 alone is insufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2: S has one sister R.

This statement indicates that R is a sister of S. Since Q is the brother of R, it means that Q is also a brother of S. Therefore, Statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Now, let's consider the combinations of the two statements:

1. Statement 1 and Statement 2 taken together:

We know that R is the niece of P and S has one sister R. This means that P is the uncle of R, and S is the brother of R. Therefore, Q, who is the brother of R, is also the brother of S. So, the combination of the two statements is sufficient to answer the question.

Therefore, the correct option is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
Option (D) is the correct answer.

Here's why:

Statement 1 alone is insufficient because it only tells us that black ants cannot be found indoors, but it doesn't give us any information about the number of red ants or any other type of ants that may be present in the room.

Statement 2 alone is sufficient because it gives us specific information about the number of red ants in the room, which allows us to determine the total number of ants in the room. If there are seven red ants in the room, and we know that only red ants and black ants are present in the room, then we can conclude that there are a total of 7 + x number of black ants in the room, where x is the number of black ants.

Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 taken together is sufficient because statement 1 only tells us about the absence of black ants, and statement 2 only gives us information about the number of red ants. Together, they still don't give us enough information to determine the total number of ants in the room.

Therefore, the correct option is (D), statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
The question is asking us to determine which statement(s) are sufficient to answer the question "What time does the clock show?"

Let's analyze each statement individually:

1. The hour hand is between 5 and 6.

This statement alone is not sufficient to determine the time. The hour hand could be anywhere between 5 and 6, so we need more information to narrow down the possible times.

2. The clock shows a quarter past five.

This statement alone is sufficient to determine the time. Since the clock shows a quarter past five, we know that the time is 5:15.

Now let's consider the two statements together:

If we combine the two statements, we can conclude that the time is between 5:00 and 5:15, since the hour hand is between 5 and 6, and the clock shows a quarter past five. However, we still can't pinpoint the exact time without more information.

Therefore, the correct option is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Here's a summary of the analysis:

* Statement 1 alone is not sufficient (insufficient)
* Statement 2 alone is sufficient (sufficient)
* Statements 1 and 2 taken together are sufficient (sufficient)

So, option (D) is the correct answer.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
option (D) is the correct answer.

Statement 1 alone is not sufficient to determine the direction of P relative to Q, as it only provides information about the location of R relative to Q, and does not provide any information about the location of P.

Statement 2 alone is not sufficient to determine the direction of P relative to Q, as it only provides information about the location of P relative to S, and does not provide any information about the location of Q.

However, when we combine both statements, we can determine the direction of P relative to Q. From statement 1, we know that Q is to the north of R, and from statement 2, we know that P is to the north-west of S. Therefore, we can conclude that P is to the north-west of Q.

So, the correct option is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Here's a diagram to illustrate the situation:

Q (north)

Option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient, while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Let's analyze this option:

Statement 1: B has two brothers, Nishant and Arav.

From this statement, we know that B has two brothers, but we don't know anything about A. We don't know if A is related to B or not. Therefore, statement 1 alone is not sufficient to determine the relationship between A and B.

Statement 2: A's father is the brother of Arav's mother.

From this statement, we know that A's father and Arav's mother have a sibling relationship. Therefore, A and Arav are first cousins. Since B has two brothers, Nishant and Arav, and Arav is a brother of A, we can conclude that B and A are also first cousins.

Therefore, option A is incorrect.

Option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient, while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Let's analyze this option:

Statement 1: B has two brothers, Nishant and Arav.

From this statement, we know that B has two brothers, but we don't know anything about A. We don't know if A is related to B or not. Therefore, statement 1 alone is not sufficient to determine the relationship between A and B.

Statement 2: A's father is the brother of Arav's mother.

From this statement, we know that A's father and Arav's mother have a sibling relationship. Therefore, A and Arav are first cousins. Since B has two brothers, Nishant and Arav, and Arav is a brother of A, we can conclude that B and A are also first cousins.

Therefore, option B is correct.

Option C: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Let's analyze this option:

Statement 1: B has two brothers, Nishant and Arav.

From this statement, we know that B has two brothers, but we don't know anything about A. We don't know if A is related to B or not. Therefore, statement 1 alone is not sufficient to determine the relationship between A and B.

Statement 2: A's father is the brother of Arav's mother.

From this statement, we know that A's father and Arav's mother have a sibling relationship. Therefore, A and Arav are first cousins. Since B has two brothers, Nishant and Arav, and Arav is a brother of A, we can conclude that B and A are also first cousins.

Therefore, either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient to determine the relationship between A and B, which is first cousins.

Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Let's analyze this option:

Statement 1: B has two brothers, Nishant and Arav.

From this statement, we know that B has two brothers, but we don't know anything about A. We don't know if A is related to B or not. Therefore, statement 1 alone is not sufficient to determine the relationship between A and B.

Statement 2: A's father is the brother of Arav's mother.

From this statement, we know that A's father and Arav's mother have a sibling relationship. Therefore, A and Arav are first cousins. Since B has two brothers, Nishant and Arav, and Arav is a brother of A, we can conclude that B and A are also first cousins.

Therefore, statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to determine the relationship between A and B, which is first cousins.

We don't know if B is related to A or not. Therefore, statement 2 alone is not sufficient to determine the relationship between A and B.

Therefore, neither statement 1 nor statement 2 alone is sufficient to determine the relationship between A and B. However, statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to determine the relationship between A and B, which is first cousins.

Therefore, option E is incorrect.

Conclusion:

The correct option is option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient, while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

The reasoning is as follows:

* Statement 1: B has two brothers, Nishant and Arav. This statement alone is not sufficient to determine the relationship between A and B.

Correct answer: E
Option (D) is the correct answer.

Here's why:

Statement 1: "Buses usually depart on time."

This statement does not provide any specific information about the bus schedule or the exact departure time for the bus going to the airport. Therefore, this statement alone is not sufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2: "The scheduled arrival is at 11:40 a.m."

This statement provides some useful information, as it tells us that the bus is scheduled to arrive at the airport at 11:40 a.m. However, it does not provide the departure time for the bus. Therefore, this statement alone is not sufficient to answer the question.

When we combine both statements, we can infer the departure time for the bus. If the scheduled arrival time is 11:40 a.m. and buses usually depart on time, then it is likely that the bus left the starting point at around 10:40 a.m. to arrive at the airport at 11:40 a.m.

Therefore, option (D) "Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient" is the correct answer.

Here's a summary of the logic for each option:

Option (A): Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

* Statement 1 does not provide enough information to determine the departure time.
* Statement 2 provides some useful information, but it does not provide the departure time.

Option (B): Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

* Statement 2 provides the scheduled arrival time, but it does not provide the departure time.
* Statement 1 does not provide any specific information about the bus schedule.

Option (C): Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

* Statement 1 does not provide enough information to determine the departure time.
* Statement 2 provides some useful information, but it does not provide the departure time.

Option (E): Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

* This option is incorrect because when we combine both statements, we can infer the departure time for the bus.

Therefore, option (D) "Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient" is the correct answer.

[/INST]


Correct answer: A
The question is asking whether Ajay is the only son of Aparna.

Statement 1: Aparna's brother has only one nephew.

* Logic for sufficiency: If Aparna's brother has only one nephew, and that nephew is Ajay, then Ajay must be the only son of Aparna. Therefore, statement 1 is sufficient to answer the question.
* Logic against sufficiency: However, if Aparna's brother has only one nephew, but that nephew is not Ajay, then Ajay could still have other siblings. Therefore, statement 1 is not sufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2: Ruhi is Ajay's sister.

* Logic for sufficiency: If Ruhi is Ajay's sister, then Ajay must have at least one sibling, which means he is not the only son of Aparna. Therefore, statement 2 is sufficient to answer the question.
* Logic against sufficiency: However, if Ruhi is Ajay's sister, but Ajay has other siblings as well, then statement 2 is not sufficient to answer the question.

Taking both statements together:

* Logic for sufficiency: If Aparna's brother has only one nephew, and Ruhi is Ajay's sister, then Ajay must be the only son of Aparna. Therefore, both statements taken together are sufficient to answer the question.
* Logic against sufficiency: However, if Aparna's brother has only one nephew, but that nephew is not Ajay, and Ruhi is Ajay's sister, then Ajay could still have other siblings. Therefore, both statements taken together are not sufficient to answer the question.

The correct option is (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Therefore, the answer to the question "Is Ajay the only son of Aparna?" is:

(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Explanation:
Statement 1 alone is not sufficient to answer the question, as it only tells us that Aparna's brother has only one nephew, but we don't know if that nephew is Ajay or not.

Statement 2 alone is also not sufficient, as it only tells us that Ruhi is Ajay's sister, but we don't know if Ajay has other siblings as well.

However, taking both statements together, we can conclude that Ajay is the only son of Aparna. If Aparna's brother has only one nephew, and that nephew is Ajay, then Ajay must be the only son of Aparna. Additionally, if Ruhi is Ajay's sister, then Ajay must have at least one sibling, which means he is not the only son of Aparna. Therefore, both statements taken together are sufficient to answer the question.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
From statements 1 and 2, we can try to find the number of students sitting in a row by figuring out their positions in the row.

From Statement 1, we can deduce that Kavya is 9th to the left of Aadesh. Since Aadesh is 7th from the right end, Kavya is 9th + 7 = 16th from the right end.

From Statement 2, we can deduce that Jagrav is 8th to the right of Neerja, who is 16th from the right end and 5th from the left end. Therefore, Jagrav is 16th + 8 = 24th from the right end.

For Statement 1 to be sufficient, we need to know the position of Aadesh. Since Aadesh is 7th from the right end, we can find Kavya's position, which is 16th from the right end. Therefore, Statement 1 is insufficient.

For Statement 2 to be sufficient, we need to know the position of Neerja. Since Neerja is 16th from the right end and 5th from the left end, we can find Jagrav's position, which is 24th from the right end. However, we cannot find the position of Aadesh, and thus the number of students sitting in a row, using only Statement 2. Therefore, Statement 2 is also insufficient.

Since neither Statement 1 nor Statement 2 is sufficient alone, the correct option is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Using both statements, we can find the positions of both Kavya (16th from the right end) and Jagrav (24th from the right end). Thus, we can find the number of students sitting in a row by counting the number of students between them, which is sufficient to answer the question. 

Therefore, the correct option is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

The correct answer is option (D).

Answer: D

logic:

For statement 1 to be sufficient, we need to know Aadesh's position. Since Aadesh is seventh from the right end, we can find Kavya's position, which is 16th from the right end. Therefore, statement 1 is insufficient.

For statement 2 to be sufficient, we need to know Neerja's position. Since Neerja is 16th from the right end and fifth from the left end, we can find Jagrav's position, which is 24th from the right end. However, we cannot find the position of Aadesh, and thus the number of students sitting in a row, using only statement 2. Therefore, statement 2 is also insufficient.

Since neither statement 1 nor statement 2 is sufficient alone, the correct option is (D) statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Using both statements, we can find the positions of both Kavya (16th from the right end) and Jagrav (24th from the right end). Thus, we can answer the question by counting the number of students between them. Therefore, the answer is option (D).

* Green = Brown

With this mapping, we can determine the color of a fresh tomato:

* A fresh tomato is typically red.
* In the game, red is called orange.
* Therefore, a fresh tomato is orange.

So, option (D) is the correct answer: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to answer the question.
Given answer: D


<s>[INST]Kubera, the wealthy king of the Yakshas, liked all things made of gold and silver. The king decided to gift every Yaksha family a spherical globe made of solid gold with a cylindrical silver rod passing through its center. His goldsmith told him that this would require a 6 cm long, perfectly cylindrical hole to be bored through each perfectly spherical golden globe in order to insert the silver piece. Only the gold surrounding the curved surface of the silver cylinder would be retained. Kubera wanted the silver rod to be inserted but he was worried that gold was going to have to be removed from each of the globes. The goldsmith assured him that there would still be a fair bit of gold still left after the drilling.
What was the remaining volume of the golden globe, after drilling, when it was ready to be inserted with the silver rod?
Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Each silver rod was perfectly aligned perfectly with the vertical axis of the globe.
2. The diameter of the silver rod was exactly 1.25 cm.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (F) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(F). The question can be answered without either statement.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: F
Option (D) is the correct answer.

Statement 1 alone is not sufficient because it does not provide any information about the volume of the golden globe after drilling. It only tells us that the silver rod is aligned with the vertical axis of the globe, which does not help us determine the volume of the remaining gold.

Statement 2 alone is not sufficient because it only provides the diameter of the silver rod, which is not enough information to determine the volume of the remaining gold. We need to know the length of the silver rod and the diameter of the hole drilled in the globe to calculate the volume of the remaining gold.

However, if we combine Statements 1 and 2, we can calculate the volume of the remaining gold. We know that the silver rod is perfectly aligned with the vertical axis of the globe, so the hole drilled in the globe is also aligned with the vertical axis. Therefore, the volume of the remaining gold is equal to the volume of the sphere minus the volume of the cylinder.

The formula for the volume of a sphere is:

V = (4/3)πr^3

where r is the radius of the sphere.

The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:

V = πr^2h

where r is the radius of the cylinder and h is its height.

We know that the diameter of the silver rod is 1.25 cm, so the radius of the cylinder is 0.625 cm. The height of the cylinder is 6 cm, since the silver rod is 6 cm long.

Substituting these values into the formula for the volume of the cylinder, we get:

V = π(0.625)^2 \* 6 = 3.1416 cm^3

Now, we need to subtract the volume of the cylinder from the volume of the sphere to get the volume of the remaining gold. We can use the formula for the volume of a sphere:

V = (4/3)π(0.625)^3 = 2.1622 cm^3

Therefore, the remaining volume of the golden globe after drilling is 2.1622 cm^3 - 3.1416 cm^3 = -1.0794 cm^3.

Since the volume of the remaining gold is negative, it means that the silver rod occupies more space than the golden globe, which is not possible. Therefore, the assumptions in the question are incorrect, and we cannot determine the remaining volume of the golden globe.

In conclusion, both statements 1 and 2 are necessary to calculate the volume of the remaining gold, but the question has a logical flaw, and the answer cannot be determined. Therefore, the correct option is (F) The question can be answered without either statement.

<s>[INST]How many pages of a history textbook were read on Thursday? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. The last 54 pages were read after lunch on Friday.
2. The book has 380 pages out of which three-fifths were read by Wednesday.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
The question asks how many pages of a history textbook were read on Thursday.

Statement 1 says that the last 54 pages were read after lunch on Friday. This means that the pages read on Thursday would be the pages before the last 54 pages, which is not explicitly mentioned in the statement. Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2 states that three-fifths of the book's pages were read by Wednesday. Since three-fifths of 380 pages is 240 pages, we know that 140 pages were left unread by Wednesday. To find out how many pages were read on Thursday, we would need to subtract the number of pages read on Thursday from 140. However, the statement doesn't give us that information directly. It only tells us that three-fifths of the book was read by Wednesday, which means we can't calculate the number of pages read on Thursday. Therefore, statement 2 alone is also insufficient to answer the question.

Now let's consider the options:

(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
As we determined, statement 1 alone is insufficient. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
We also determined that statement 2 alone is insufficient. Therefore, this option is also incorrect.

(C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
Since neither statement 1 nor statement 2 alone is sufficient, this option is incorrect.

(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
Combining both statements, we know that 140 pages were left unread by Wednesday (from statement 2), and the last 54 pages were read after lunch on Friday (from statement 1). Therefore, we can calculate the number of pages read on Thursday by subtracting 54 from 140, which gives us 86 pages read on Thursday. So, taken together, statements 1 and 2 are sufficient to answer the question.

(E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
This option is incorrect since we've just shown that statements 1 and 2 taken together are sufficient.

Therefore, the correct answer is option (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
Option (D) is the correct answer.

Statement 1 alone is insufficient because it only tells us that Karan has a sister, but it doesn' mediaId efficiently tell us that Jhanvi is that sister.

Statement 2 alone is insufficient because it only tells us that Jhanvi has a brother, but it doesn't necessarily mean that Karan is that brother.

However, if we combine both statements, we can conclude that Karan and Jhanvi are siblings. Karan's statement that he has one sister and Jhanvi's statement that she has one brother imply that they are referring to each other.

Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer.

Logic for and against each statement being sufficient:

Statement 1:

* For: It tells us that Karan has a sister, which could potentially help us identify Jhanvi as his sister.
* Against: It doesn't directly mention Jhanvi, so it's possible that Karan's sister is someone else entirely.

Statement 2:

* For: It tells us that Jhanvi has a brother, which could potentially help us identify Karan as her brother.
* Against: It doesn't directly mention Karan, so it's possible that Jhanvi's brother is someone else entirely.

Combining both statements:

* For: It confirms that Karan and Jhanvi are siblings, as they both refer to each other as brother and sister.
* Against: None, as combining both statements provides sufficient information to answer the question.

Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
There are four children in a family, and we want to determine how many girls there are.

Statement 1: Each girl has twice as many sisters as brothers.

* Sufficient: No, this statement doesn's tell us anything about the number of girls in the family. It only tells us that the number of girls is twice the number of boys, but we don't know the number of boys.

Statement 2: The youngest child is a boy and he has 3 sisters.

* Sufficient: Yes, this statement is sufficient. We know that the youngest child is a boy, and he has 3 sisters, so there are 3 girls in the family.

So, the correct option is (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient, while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Here's why statement 1 is not sufficient:

1. If there are 4 girls and 0 boys, each girl has 2 times as many sisters as brothers (4 girls - 0 boys = 4 girls), but we don't know how many girls there are.
2. If there are 3 girls and 1 boy, each girl has 2 times as many sisters as brothers (3 girls - 1 boy = 2 girls), but we don't know how many girls there are.
3. If there are 2 girls and 2 boys, each girl has 2 times as many sisters as brothers (2 girls - 2 boys = 0 girls), but we know that there are at least 2 girls in the family.

So, statement 1 doesn't give us any information about the number of girls in the family.

Here's why statement 2 is sufficient:

We know that the youngest child is a boy, and he has 3 sisters. This means that there are at least 3 girls in the family. Since we know that there are 4 children in total, we can deduce that there is one boy and 3 girls in the family.

Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer.

<s>[INST]At the finals of the All India Logic competition, the announcer displays six words:  MOSS, DRAG, CULT, CHOP, TRIM, GUTS. Each of the 4 finalists, representing the 4 regional champions within India (North, South, East & West), is given an envelope. Each of those 4 envelopes bear one distinct letter from one of those six words. All those distinct letters in the three envelopes are chosen from the same word. The contestants are forbidden from disclosing the letter in their envelope to anybody else. Each contestant has to determine the chosen word from the list of six.
The announcer asks the Eastern contestant, Durga, whether she can deduce the word. She instantly replies, “Yes!” Without asking her to identify the word, the announcer now moves to the regional champion from the North, Lakshmi and asks her whether she can identify the word. She thinks for a few seconds and then breaks into a smile, “Yes, I know the word.”
What is the word?
Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1.After Lakshmi, the announcer now looks at the contestant from the West and asks, “Saraswati , what about you?” Within moments, she too breaks into a smile and nods, “I know the word!”
2. The last person to answer is Meenakshi. She says, “Now I also know the word.”

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.

Correct answer: D
Option A is incorrect because Statement 1 alone is not sufficient to determine the word. We know that Lakshmi and Saraswati both know the word, but we don't know what letter they received.

Option B is also incorrect because Statement 2 alone is not sufficient to determine the word. Meenakshi saying that she also knows the word doesn't give us any new information about the word itself.

Option C is incorrect because either statement alone is not sufficient to determine the word. We need both statements together to figure out the word.

Option D is the correct option. Both statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to determine the word. We know that Lakshmi and Saraswati both know the word, and Meenakshi also knows the word. Therefore, the word must be the same letter that is in all three envelopes.

So, the correct answer is option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient. The word is "GUTS" since all three letters (G, U, and S) are present in the envelopes of the three regional champions.

Correct answer: B
Answer: The correct option is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Logic:

Statement 1: A is not lighter than C.

* This statement does not provide any information about the relative weights of A and B.
* Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient to determine if A is heavier than B.

Statement 2: D weighs the same as A and B is heavier than D.

* This statement provides information about the relative weights of A, B, and D.
* Since D weighs the same as A, we can conclude that A and D have the same weight.
* Since B is heavier than D, we can conclude that B is heavier than A and D.
* Therefore, statement 2 alone is sufficient to determine that A is not heavier than B.

Taken together, statements 1 and 2 provide sufficient information to determine that A is not heavier than B. Therefore, the correct option is (D).

Option (A) is incorrect because statement 1 alone is insufficient to determine if A is heavier than B.

Option (B) is incorrect because statement 2 alone is sufficient to determine that A is not heavier than B.

Option (C) is incorrect because statement 1 alone is insufficient, and statement 2 alone is sufficient, so either statement 1 or statement 2 is not sufficient.

[/INST]


Correct answer: E
The question asks which word in the code language means 'leaf'. To determine this, we need to find the word that is associated with the meaning of 'leaf'.

Let's analyze the given statements:

1. 'apo fu qe nane' means 'mango leaf is long' and 'nane ko' means 'long stick'.

This statement does not directly reveal the meaning of 'leaf' in the code language. However, it suggests that 'nane' might refer to a physical object with length, like a stick. But we cannot conclude that 'nane' means 'leaf' based on this statement alone.

2. 'apo qe lans' means 'green mango leaf' and 'ka lans' means 'green book'.

This statement provides a clear association between 'lans' and 'leaf'. It suggests that 'lans' is used to describe something green and leaf-like. Therefore, 'lans' is likely the word that means 'leaf' in the code language.

Now, let's consider the options:

(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

We have already determined that statement 1 alone does not provide sufficient information to determine the meaning of 'leaf'. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Statement 2 provides the necessary information to determine the meaning of 'leaf', so this option is correct.

(C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone is not sufficient, and statement 2 alone is sufficient.

(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 2 alone is sufficient, and statement 1 does not add any new information about the meaning of 'leaf'.

(E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 2 alone provides sufficient information to determine the meaning of 'leaf'.

Therefore, the correct option is (B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

The correct answer is 'lans', which means 'leaf' in the code language.

Correct answer: A
Option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient, Statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Logic:

* Statement 1 provides information about the rate at which the tank is filled, specifically that it takes half an hour to fill seven-twelfths of the tank.
* Statement 2 provides information about when the pump is switched on, but does not provide any information about the rate at which the tank is filled.

Option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient, Statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Logic:

* Statement 2 provides information about when the pump is switched on, which is necessary to determine how long it will take to fill the tank.
* Statement 1 does not provide any information about the rate at which the tank is filled, so it is insufficient on its own.

Option C: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Logic:

* Statement 1 provides information about the rate at which the tank is filled, which is necessary to determine how long it will take to fill the tank.
* Statement 2 provides information about when the pump is switched on, which is necessary to determine how long it will take to fill the tank.
* Therefore, either statement 1 or statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Logic:

* Statement 1 provides information about the rate at which the tank is filled.
* Statement 2 provides information about when the pump is switched on.
* Together, statements 1 and 2 provide enough information to determine how long it will take to fill the tank.

Option E: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Logic:

* Statement 1 does not provide enough information to determine how long it will take to fill the tank, as it only provides information about the rate at which the tank is filled.
* Statement 2 does not provide enough information to determine how long it will take to fill the tank, as it only provides information about when the pump is switched on.
* Statements 1 and 2 taken together do not provide enough information to determine how long it will take to fill the tank, as they only provide information about the rate at which the tank is filled and when the pump is switched on.

Conclusion:

The correct option is D, Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient. This is because together, statements 1 and 2 provide enough information to determine how long it will take to fill the tank.

The question asks how long the CEO's speech was.
Let's evaluate each statement and determine if it is sufficient to answer the question.

Statement 1: The CEO spoke 30 words per minute.
This statement provides the rate at which the CEO spoke, but it does not directly give the duration of the speech.
Therefore, this statement alone is insufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2: Had the CEO spoken 5 fewer words per minute, her speech would have lasted 4 more minutes.
This statement provides additional information about the relationship between the CEO's speaking rate and the duration of the speech.
If the CEO had spoken 5 fewer words per minute, her speech would have lasted 4 more minutes.
This means that the speech's duration is dependent on the CEO's speaking rate.
Therefore, this statement alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Now, let's evaluate the five options:

Option (A): Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone is insufficient, and statement 2 alone is sufficient.

Option (B): Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
This option is correct. Statement 2 provides information about the relationship between the CEO's speaking rate and the speech's duration, which allows us to determine the duration of the speech.

Option (C): Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
This option is incorrect. Statement 1 alone is insufficient, and statement 2 alone is sufficient.

Option (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
This option is incorrect. Although both statements provide information about the CEO's speaking rate and the speech's duration, they do not provide enough information to determine the duration of the speech exactly.

Option (E): Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together are sufficient.
This option is incorrect. Statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Therefore, the correct option is (B): Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

[/INST]


Correct answer: E
Our question is, "How many daughters does Devi have?"

Let's evaluate the statements:

1. X's father has 3 children.

This statement doesn't provide any information about Devi's family or the number of daughters she has. Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient to answer the question.

2. Y is X's sister and daughter of Devi.

This statement reveals that Y is a daughter of Devi, and since Y is also X's sister, we know that X and Y have the same mother, who is Devi. Therefore, statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Now, let's consider the options:

(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 doesn't provide any information about Devi's family or the number of daughters she has.

(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

This option is correct. Statement 2 reveals that Y is a daughter of Devi, and since Y is also X's sister, we know that X and Y have the same mother, who is Devi. Therefore, statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

(C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone is insufficient, and statement 2 alone is sufficient.

(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 doesn't provide any information about Devi's family or the number of daughters she has, and statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

(E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Therefore, the correct option is (B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
There are five friends: Anjali, Arun, Ritika, Vishwesh, and Kartik. The question is, who is the tallest?

Statement 1: Anjali is taller than Arun and Kartik.

* Sufficient: No, this statement alone does not provide enough information to determine who the tallest person is. It only tells us that Anjali is taller than Arun and Kartik, but it does not provide any information about Ritika and Vishwesh.

Statement 2: Arun is shorter than Ritika but taller than Vishwesh.

* Sufficient: No, this statement alone does not provide enough information to determine who the tallest person is. It only tells us that Arun is shorter than Ritika but taller than Vishwesh, but it does not provide any information about Anjali and Kartik.

Now let's consider both statements together:

* Sufficient: Yes, both statements together provide enough information to determine who the tallest person is. From statement 1, we know that Anjali is taller than Arun and Kartik. From statement 2, we know that Arun is shorter than Ritika but taller than Vishwesh. Therefore, the tallest person among the five friends is Anjali, followed by Ritika, Arun, Vishwesh, and Kartik in descending order of height.

Therefore, the correct option is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to answer the question.

Let's consider why option (A) and option (B) are incorrect:

Option (A): Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone does not provide enough information to determine who the tallest person is. We need statement 2 to know the relative heights of Ritika and Vishwesh.

Option (B): Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
This option is incorrect because statement 2 alone does not provide enough information to determine who the tallest person is. We need statement 1 to know that Anjali is taller than Arun and Kartik.

Option (C): Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
This option is incorrect because both statements are needed to determine the relative heights of all five friends.

Option (E): Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
This option is incorrect because we have shown that both statements taken together are sufficient to determine the relative heights of all five friends.

Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
Option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient, while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

 logic for:

* Statement 1 reveals that X's father is married to Z, which means X and Y are siblings.
* Therefore, X and Y have a direct familial relationship, which answers the question of how X is related to Y.

logic against:

* Statement 2 does not provide any information about X's relationship to Y.
* Statement 2 only tells us that Z has a son and daughter, but it does not specify which of the two is X.

Option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient, while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

logic for:

* Statement 2 reveals that Z has a daughter, which means Y is Z's daughter.
* Since X's father is married to Z, X and Y are siblings.
* Therefore, statement 2 provides enough information to answer the question of how X is related to Y.

logic against:

* Statement 1 does not provide any information about X's relationship to Y.
* Statement 1 only tells us that X's father is married to Z, but it does not imply a direct sibling relationship between X and Y.

Option C: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

logic for:

* Statement 1 or statement 2 alone can provide enough information to answer the question of how X is related to Y.
* If statement 1 is true, then X and Y are siblings.
* If statement 2 is true, then Y is Z's daughter, and since X's father is married to Z, X and Y are siblings.

logic against:

* Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 provides a complete picture of X's relationship to Y.
* Statement 1 does not mention Y, and statement 2 does not mention X.

Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

logic for:

* Taken together, statement 1 and statement 2 provide a complete picture of X's relationship to Y.
* Statement 1 tells us that X's father is married to Z, and statement 2 tells us that Z has a daughter named Y.
* Therefore, X and Y are siblings.

logic against:

* Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 alone provides enough information to answer the question of how X is related to Y.

Option E: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

logic for:

* None of the statements provide a direct answer to the question of how X is related to Y.
* Statements 1 and 2 provide some information about X's family, but they do not explicitly state how X is related to Y.

logic against:

* At least one of the statements must provide some information about X's relationship to Y.

Conclusion:

The correct option is D. Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to answer the question of how X is related to Y. They provide a complete picture of X's family, which implies a direct sibling relationship between X and Y. Therefore, the answer is (D).

Correct answer: D
Option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient, while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

 logic for statement 1 being sufficient:
If A plays hockey, then A cannot play cricket. Therefore, we can eliminate A as a possible cricket player. Since B, C, and D are the only remaining players, one of them must play cricket. Therefore, statement 1 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

 logic against statement 2 being sufficient:
Statememnt 2 only tells us that C does not play chess or football. It does not provide any information about cricket. Therefore, statement 2 alone is insufficient to answer the question.

Option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient, while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

 logic for statement 2 being sufficient:
If C plays neither chess nor football, then C must play cricket. Therefore, statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

 logic against statement 1 being sufficient:
Statement 1 only tells us that A plays hockey. It does not provide any information about cricket. Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient to answer the question.

Option C: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

 logic for statement 1 being sufficient:

 logic for statement 2 being sufficient:
See the logic for option B.

 Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

 logic for statement 1 and statement 2 being sufficient:
See the logic for option A and option B.

 logic against statement 1 and statement 2 being sufficient:
If we combine statement 1 and statement 2, we still cannot determine who plays cricket. A could still play cricket, and C could still play cricket. Therefore, statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are not sufficient to answer the question.

 Option E: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

 logic for neither statement 1 nor statement 2 being sufficient:
See the logic against statement 1 being sufficient in option A and the logic against statement 2 being sufficient in option B.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
The question asks how much a clock loses in a day. To determine the loss, we need to know the clock's rate of error, which can be calculated using the clock's mechanism, specifically the interval between the hour and minute hands' coincidence.

Now, let's evaluate the statements:

1. The clock shows 7:45 a.m.

This statement only tells us the time on the clock but doesn't provide any information about the clock's mechanism or rate of error. Therefore, this statement is insufficient to answer the question.

2. The hour and minute hands coincide every 63 minutes starting at noon.

This statement reveals that the clock has a mechanism where the hour and minute hands coincide every 63 minutes. This interval is consistent and can be used to calculate the clock's rate of error.

Now, let's consider the options:

(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Since statement 1 doesn't provide any information about the clock's mechanism or rate of error, it is not sufficient to answer the question. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Statement 2 provides information about the clock's mechanism, which can be used to calculate the clock's rate of error. Therefore, this statement is sufficient to answer the question.

(C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

We have already determined that statement 1 is insufficient, and statement 2 is sufficient. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Combining the information from both statements, we can calculate the clock's rate of error using the interval provided in statement 2 and the time on the clock given in statement 1. Therefore, this option is correct.

(E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

We have already determined that statement 2 is sufficient, and combining statement 1 and 2 provides sufficient information to calculate the clock's rate of error. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

The correct answer is option (D), as statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to answer the question. We can use the information from statement 2 to calculate the clock's rate of error and determine the loss in a day.

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
The question asks for the number of tabla instructors teaching in the city.

Let's analyze the statements:

1. There is one tabla instructor for each of the 52 classes held in this city.

This statement alone is sufficient to answer the question. If there is one instructor for each class, then the number of instructors is equal to the number of classes, which is 52.

2. Each tabla instructor teaches 5 students.

This statement alone is not sufficient to answer the question. Knowing the number of students per instructor doesn't give us the total number of instructors.

Now, let's consider both statements together:

If we combine both statements, we can calculate the total number of instructors. We know that each instructor teaches 5 students, and there are 52 classes. Thus, the total number of students is 52 x 5 = 260. Since there is one instructor for each class, there are 260 instructors in total.

So, the correct option is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to answer the question.

Here's a summary of our analysis:

Option (A) is incorrect because statement 1 alone is sufficient, but statement 2 alone is not.

Option (B) is incorrect because statement 2 alone is not sufficient, and statement 1 alone is sufficient.

Option (C) is incorrect because either statement 1 or statement 2 alone is not sufficient.

Option (E) is incorrect because both statements taken together are sufficient to answer the question.

Therefore, the correct option is (D), as both statements 1 and 2 taken together are sufficient to answer the question.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
Option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient.

Logic for:

* Statement 1 provides the overall percentage of male and female births in a given year.
* This information can be used to determine the number of male and female births in each hospital, assuming that the hospitals have similar delivery rates.
* Since the nearby hospital has a small maternity ward, it is likely to have fewer births overall compared to the far-away hospital with a larger maternity ward.
* Therefore, the nearby hospital is more likely to have a higher proportion of male births than the far-away hospital, given the same total number of births.

Logic against:

* Statement 1 only provides the overall percentage of male and female births, not the actual number of births in each hospital.
* Without knowing the actual number of births in each hospital, we cannot determine which hospital has more male births than female births.

Option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient.

Logic for:

* Statement 2 provides information about the size of the maternity wards in each hospital.
* The nearby hospital has a small maternity ward, which suggests that it may have fewer births overall compared to the far-away hospital with a larger maternity ward.
* If the nearby hospital has fewer births, it is more likely to have a higher proportion of male births than the far-away hospital, given the same total number of births.

Logic against:

* Statement 2 only provides information about the size of the maternity wards, not the actual number of births in each hospital.
* Without knowing the actual number of births in each hospital, we cannot determine which hospital has more male births than female births.

Option C: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Logic for:

* Statement 1 provides the overall percentage of male and female births in a given year, which can be used to determine the number of male and female births in each hospital.
* Statement 2 provides information about the size of the maternity wards in each hospital, which can be used to infer the number of births in each hospital.
* Either statement alone can provide sufficient information to determine which hospital has more male births than female births.

Logic against:

* Neither statement provides complete information about the number of births in each hospital.
* Without knowing the actual number of births in each hospital, we cannot determine which hospital has more male births than female births.

Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Logic for:

* Statement 1 provides the overall percentage of male and female births in a given year.
* Statement 2 provides information about the size of the maternity wards in each hospital.
* By combining the two statements, we can infer the number of male and female births in each hospital.
* We can then use this information to determine which hospital has more male births than female births.

Logic against:

* The information provided by the two statements may not be accurate or up-to-date.
* There may be other factors that affect the number of male and female births in each hospital, such as the demographics of the populations served by each hospital.

Option E: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Logic for:

* Statements 1 and 2 provide some information about the number of male and female births and the size of the maternity wards in each hospital.
* However, this information is not sufficient to determine which hospital has more male births than female births.
* There may be other factors that affect the number of male and female births in each hospital, such as the demographics of the populations served by each hospital.

Conclusion:

The correct option is D, Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

By combining the information provided by both statements, we can infer the number of male and female births in each hospital and determine which hospital has more male births than female births. However, it is important to note that this conclusion is based on the assumptions that the information provided by the statements is accurate and up-to-date, and that there are no other factors that affect the number of male and female births in each hospital.

Correct answer: E
There are several ways to approach this question, but one systematic way to do so is to use a truth table. A truth table is a table that lists all possible combinations of values for the variables in the statements and indicates whether each statement is true or false.

Here is a truth table for this question:

| C is B's spouse | A is C's relative | Is A B's brother? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| True | True | True |
| True | False | False |
| False | True | False |
| False | False | False |

From this truth table, we can see that:

* Statement 1 alone is sufficient to answer the question, because if C is B's spouse, then A is B's brother.
* Statement 2 alone is not sufficient to answer the question, because if A is C's relative, it does not necessarily follow that A is B's brother.
* Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient, because if we know that C is B's spouse, we can conclude that A is B's brother, and if we know that A is C's relative, we can conclude that A is B's brother.
* Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are not sufficient, because even if we know that C is B's spouse and A is C's relative, we still cannot conclude that A is B's brother.
* Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient, because there are possible combinations of values for the variables that make the statements true but do not allow us to conclude that A is B's brother.

Based on this analysis, the correct option is (C), Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Correct answer: A
Option A is incorrect because statement 1 alone does not provide enough information to determine how many fans went to the stadium yesterday. It only tells us the number of single-person tickets sold, but it does not account for the number of multi-person tickets sold or the number of people who attended the event without buying tickets. 

Statement 2 alone is also insufficient, as it only provides the total capacity of the stadium and does not give any information about the actual number of attendees. 

Option C is incorrect because neither statement 1 nor statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question. Statement 1 does not provide enough information about the total number of attendees, and statement 2 only provides the capacity of the stadium, not the actual number of attendees. 

Option D is incorrect because taking both statements together does not provide a definite answer to the question. We would still need additional information to determine how many fans attended the event.

Option E is the correct answer. Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor both taken together are sufficient to determine how many fans went to the stadium yesterday. We would need additional information, such as the number of multi-person tickets sold or the number of people who attended without buying tickets, to answer the question.

The correct answer is E, as none of the given statements, either alone or together, are sufficient to determine how many fans went to the stadium yesterday.

[/INST]


Correct answer: D
There are 4 friends - M, N, O, and P. The question is, how many friends are older than O?

Statement 1: M is not younger than P and O is older than N.

* Logic for: This statement tells us that O is older than N, and M is not younger than P. This means that M and P are both older than O.
* Logic against: This statement doesn't tell us anything about the relative ages of M and P. It's possible that M and P are both younger than O, or that one of them is older than O and the other is younger.

Statement 2: P is older than exactly two friends.

* Logic for: This statement tells us that P is older than two friends, which means that there are at least two friends who are younger than P. Since O is older than N, and M is not younger than P, it's possible that the two friends who are younger than P are N and O.
* Logic against: This statement doesn't tell us which two friends are younger than P. It's possible that M and O are both younger than P, or that one of them is older than P and the other is younger.

Now, let's consider the options:

(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

* Logic: This option is correct. Statement 1 tells us that M and P are both older than O, which means that there are at least two friends who are older than O. This information is sufficient to answer the question. Statement 2, on the other hand, doesn't give us enough information to determine the relative ages of all four friends.

Therefore, the correct option is (A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

[/INST]


Correct answer: C
The question is asking for Ravi's rank from the bottom, which means we need to find out the total number of students in the class.

Statement 1: The rank list ends with rank 56.

This statement alone is not sufficient to answer the question. We know that Ravi is ranked 22 from the top, but we don't know how many students are there in total. Even if we know the last rank on the list is 56, we can't conclude Ravi's rank from the bottom without knowing the total number of students.

Statement 2: Kumar ranks 10th but is 47th from the bottom.

This statement alone is sufficient to answer the question. We know that Kumar is 10th from the top, and 47th from the bottom, which means there are 47 students below him. Since Ravi is ranked 22 from the top, we can find his rank from the bottom by subtracting 22 from 47, which gives us 25.

So, the correct option is (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Now let's consider the other options:

(A): Statement 1 alone is not sufficient to answer the question, as discussed above.

(C): Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient, but we have already determined that statement 1 alone is not sufficient, and statement 2 alone is sufficient. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

(D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are not necessary to answer the question. We can answer the question using statement 2 alone.

(E): Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient. This option is incorrect because we have determined that statement 2 alone is sufficient.

In conclusion, the correct option is (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.
Given answer: B


<s>[INST]Socks P, Q, R, S, T and U form 3 pairs. P pairs with neither Q nor R. What are the pairs? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Neither S nor T pairs with either Q or R.
2. Neither P nor Q pairs with either S or U.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.

Correct answer: D
The problem statements are:

1. Neither S nor T pairs with either Q or R.
2. Neither P nor Q pairs with either S or U.

Let's analyze each statement and determine whether it is sufficient to answer the question.

1. Neither S nor T pairs with either Q or R.

This statement tells us that S and T are not paired with Q or R. However, it doesn't give us any information about the pairing of P, Q, and R. Therefore, this statement alone is not sufficient to answer the question.

2. Neither P nor Q pairs with either S or U.

This statement tells us that P and Q are not paired with S or U. This means that P and Q must be paired with each other, as they are the only two socks left. Therefore, this statement alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Now, let's consider both statements together.

If we combine both statements, we know that P and Q are paired with each other, and S and T are not paired with Q or R. This means that S and T must be paired with each other, as they are the only two socks left. Therefore, both statements taken together are sufficient to answer the question.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

This is incorrect, as statement 1 alone is not sufficient to answer the question.

(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

This is incorrect, as statement 2 alone is not sufficient to answer the question.

(C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

This is incorrect, as statement 1 alone is not sufficient, and statement 2 alone is not sufficient, but both statements taken together are sufficient.

(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

This is correct, as both statements taken together are sufficient to answer the question.

(E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

This is incorrect, as both statements taken together are sufficient to answer the question.

Therefore, the correct option is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
