The culprit who killed James Macready is most likely Tom Jenkins. The text gives us a few hints to deduce this:

1. At the dance, Lucille Doone chooses James Macready as her betrothed, provoking jealousy among the other suitors, Tom Jenkins and Jack MacGinnis.

2. Jack MacGinnis is the first to leave the dance and went back to his own farm. If he held a grudge, he would have to have returned to the moor after getting home. However, he was always accompanied by his dogs, whose barking would have alerted James.

3. James Macready leaves the dance next, intending to cross the dangerous moor at night. When he doesn't return, a scarf given to him by Lucille is found tied to a tree branch.

4. Tom Jenkins leaves last, known for his hot temper and always carrying a gun. He would have caught up with James on the moor.

5. It's suggested that someone took on the Macready name in America. Tom Jenkins is known to have left the village and sent letters home. After James's death, Tom may have assumed the Macready name to emigrate.

Taking all these hints into account, it leads us to the conclusion that Tom Jenkins is the most likely culprit of James Macready's murder. And he also assumed the Macready name when moving to America, continuing the Macready family line in Pennsylvania.

The culprit is the father who was at the park with his wife and son. Despite his wife claiming that he had gone to try to light the park's barbecue grill, the police officer found this claim suspicious as the wife could not confirm she saw him at the grill. This indicated that the father did not have a solid alibi during the time of the bank robbery. Other suspects had plausible stories and could account for their activities during the time of the robbery. The motorcyclist's only "evidence" was his appearance, and the teenager was occupied with his science project; the elderly man was trying to exercise.

2.  It is stated that when Captain Roberts startled Will, powder fell onto the floor. This matches the white powder found near the casket from where the necklace was stolen.

3.  When asked directly, Will denies stealing the necklace, but his claim to not break the Pirate's Code may not hold. The Code likely refers to not stealing from other pirates, while Will, as a young boy thrown into piracy, might not hold the same respect for the Code that more seasoned pirates do.

Since Will is the last one in the room after the Captain, and before the theft is discovered, it is likely he is the one the parrot is mimicking. \n\nSo, putting all the pieces together, despite his initial strong denial, Will took the necklace in the brief time he was alone in the cabin.\nSo as explained, the culprit is', ['Bosun Ridley', 'Mr Arbuthnot', 'Nehemiah', 'Will'])

The culprit is Lt. Erikson. Several clues point to this:

1. Lt. Erikson was on duty at the time the SSCU was disabled and somehow "missed it" until the maintenance report came out. This implies she had the opportunity to carry out the sabotage.
   
2. Her relationship with the Major who recently promoted her is suspicious, suggesting she might have outside motivation or support for her actions.
   
3. The handprints on her back match the size of Bennington's hands and have insulation foam on them. This is the same kind of material Valance and Bennington were working with on the day of the sabotage suggesting she was there and involved in some capacity. 

So, based on this evidence, it's clear that Lt. Erikson is likely to be the saboteur. The woman’s finger found in the garbage disposal could potentially belong to her, further supporting the suspicion.

The mystery man is Stephen Cowan. The clues are as follows:

1. Stephen didn't carry a backpack or blanket. He only carried a small paper sack with food and drink, which indicates he didn't plan to sleep there.
2. When Anthony saw the dark-dressed person, Stephen was the only one who didn't have a blanket or jacket to sleep with so he could have been the one moving around.
3. Also, Stephen pointed out the miniature tombstone first, which could be an attempt to deflect suspicion away from himself.
4. Lastly, Tommy mentioning his slight nausea could be a hint that his drink was tampered with - perhaps by the one who didn't bring one of their own, like Stephen did.

All of these clues point to Stephen as the one who placed the miniature carved wooden tombstone dedicated to Edgar Allan Poe, the single shot of cognac, and the three stemmed roses. He also could have slipped Doz-a-way into the others' drinks to send them to sleep.

2. He is observed putting gum in his mouth. This could be a distraction technique. While people are focused on his gum chewing, he might have quickly and quietly slipped the banknotes out when Mr.Storimon wasn't paying attention.
3. His left hand is in a cast, providing a great concealment for the sleek action of stealing the bills. He could have kept the stolen money hidden in the cast.
4. Despite his left hand being in a cast, he is surprisingly good at performing tricks with his skateboard, indicating sufficient dexterity to carry out the theft.
5. When Mr. Storimon accused Mick of being the thief, Danny was quick to divert the blame onto himself. This could have been an innocent show of camaraderie, or it could have been a clever way to seem above suspicion.

The murderer, based on the information given, is Constance. Here are the reasons:

1. Constance stated she hates violence with guns and knives. Melody was murdered with an ice pick, not a gun or a knife, which matches her dislike for such weapons.
2. The narration mentioned that the Kairns house was well insulated and sound does not carry well in it. Despite this, Vernon, Melody's husband, noticed that Melody, a usual restless and noisy sleeper, was unusually quiet when he woke up. For someone used to the noise, this would seem very odd.
3. Going by the same logic, the sound of the murder (which would involve a struggle, however brief) would not have been heard in the well-insulated house, or else it would've woken Vernon, as suggested by her comment, "I didn’t hear anything from your room all night long."
4. The story indicates that Constance has sensitive hearing and typically had trouble sleeping because her sister snored loudly. However, she stated she didn't hear anything the night of the murder, including her sister's usual noisy sleep. This suggests she knew Melody wouldn't be making any noise that night.
5. Lastly, her statement at the end, "No, I cannot account for my time. I don’t have to because it doesn’t make any difference. The game is up.", implies an admission of guilt.

Likewise, Roxie arrived home before Greenerbaum and her bike was covered in mud, but there is no mention of mud on the scratch on the car. Malcolm carried his guitar in his right hand, but the scratch was on the left side of the Porsche - and the cars were parked driver's side to driver's side, which means the scratch would be on the wrong side, if Malcolm did it. 

However, Colonel Greenerbaum showed exactly the knowledge and capacity to make such a scratch when he used Roxie's bike to demonstrate how the scratch could have been made. The key detail is that he had a flashlight in his glove compartment, and knew exactly where to look to "reveal" the scratch as two inches longer than anyone else thought. The scratch was also clean, when it had been raining heavily - hardly the kind of weather in which a lot of detailed car inspections happen. This suggests that he, aware of the scratch, used the flashlight to clean it meticulously before accusing others. His quickness to blame and demand compensation also indicate his own guilt.

Malcolm carried his guitar in his right hand, but the scratch was on the left side of the Porsche - and the cars were parked driver\'s side to driver\'s side, which means the scratch would be on the wrong side, if Malcolm did it. \n\nHowever, Colonel Greenerbaum showed exactly the knowledge and capacity to make such a scratch when he used Roxie\'s bike to demonstrate how the scratch could have been made. The key detail is that he had a flashlight in his glove compartment, and knew exactly where to look to "reveal" the scratch as two inches longer than anyone else thought. The scratch was also clean, when it had been raining heavily - hardly the kind of weather in which a lot of detailed car inspections happen. This suggests that he, aware of the scratch, used the flashlight to clean it meticulously before accusing others. His quickness to blame and demand compensation also indicate his own guilt.\nSo as explained, the culprit is', ['Colonel Greenerbaum', 'Fido', 'Malcolm', 'Roxie'])

Given that both Robert and his wife Lucille Patrick lost everything during the War Between the States and had to move to the city of Kilgore afterwards, it makes sense that Robert, who died in 1905, would be buried here.

Also, with Cartright\'s death, his money would go to the hospital sooner rather than later, which is what Dr. Gilchrest would want if his main priority was getting the hospital updated. Despite what seemed like the start of a new, more generous chapter of Cartright\'s life, somebody might have wanted to speed things up.\nSo as explained, the culprit is', ['Dr. Gilchrest', 'Jonathan Cartright', 'Miser James Cartright (suicide)', 'Moira Laurie'])
The culprit is Dr. Gilchrest.

The culprit is Robert Bannington, also known as Quicksilver Bob. Even though it is reasonable to assume the necklace accidently fell off due to a broken clasp, the way he described that while they were dancing, a couple clumsily bumped into them, causing Countess Mannerley to momentarily lose her balance suggests he could have used that opportunity to steal the necklace. He must have been aware of weak clasp since he mentioned it in his testimonial, hence he used it to divert suspicions. Later, when he realized the investigation was starting, he hid the pearls in one of the palm tree pots in hopes of retrieving them later when the situation had calmed down.

If Jeremy was eating cookies, it is clear he was downstairs at midnight and didn’t have the chance to kiss Aly.

However, Chester was unharmed and was also keeping away from the confrontation, as per his claim of keeping the front door covered. 

Additionally, Chester was the one who conveniently had a lantern and was able to control the lighting in the shack. When the gunfire erupted, the overhead hanging lantern was suddenly shot out, plunging the shack into darkness, which is suspicious because immediately afterward Chester lit the lantern he had been told to bring with him and tossed it inside to illuminate the shack - he controlled the lighting during the critical moments. 

Taken together, his actions hint toward him being the one who fired the shots instead of Pee Wee. As the only member of the team unharmed and the one managing the light during the gunfight, plus having the opportunity being alone outside, leads us to believe that Chester Morris is the culprit who stole the loot.

The culprit in this mystery story was Darby, the family's dog. Evidence to this includes the fact that Darby was very interested in the turkey from the beginning, attempting to jump on the counter to get a closer look and smell. Moreover, they chained Darby in the backyard before heading to the store, so it’s possible that he had access to the kitchen and the opportunity to snatch the turkey. The trail of juice ending abruptly near the refrigerator could also suggest that Darby grabbed the turkey and ran off with it before it could drip any further. The fact that no human culprits were found with the turkey also adds to the likelihood that Darby is the guilty party.

2. Porter 2 is described as "distinguished" and "much too elegant to be a porter on a train". Considering Fennell was known for his disguises, this impeccable demeanor could well be a part of his disguise.
3. Moreover, Porter 2 apologizes for forgetting Ed’s name. While it might have been a genuine moment of forgetfulness considering the number of passengers, it could also be an indication that he’s not accustomed to the role of a porter, but is using it as a cover.

The blackmailer is Susan Royster.

First, she knew about Linda Amberton's past and the shoplifting incident, which was information included in the blackmail letter. She was one of the few people who had this knowledge.

Second, Susan Royster certainly had the motive, as she had lost her job at the hospital back in February.

Third, the second blackmail letter included instructions for Linda to drive to a specific location to leave the money. However, it was disclosed early in the story that Linda doesn't drive. This is a fact that would be well known to Susan Royster, who had historically served as Linda's driver in the past and "drove her over from Riverton," when Linda first moved to Centerville. 

Therefore, using this information, it can be inferred that Susan Royster is the blackmailer. She possessed the necessary knowledge of Linda's past, she had the motive, and the details of the ransom drop location implicated her.
The suspects are Horace Sage,Martin Amberton,Mary Devers,Susan Royster

The culprit is Aubrey Behrens and he was in the shop at around 10:10 p.m. Here is the reasoning: 

The grandfather clock, located far away from the area of destruction and not prone to movement, stopped at 10:10 p.m. The most likely explanation for this is the thief entering the shop and causing enough of a disturbance to halt the clock. 

We can infer that other timepieces stopped at their respective times due to events indirectly related to the thief's activities, but not necessarily because the thief was physically disturbing them at those specific times.

For example, the mantle clock, found on the floor and stopped at 10:59 p.m., could have been knocked over later by vibrations from other actions the thief took, like opening cases or moving items. 

The office clock stopped at 2:01 a.m., but given its location and type, it could have stopped due to the disturbance caused by the mouse chewing on the lamp cord and causing the circuit breaker to trip.

The wristwatch found on the floor stopped at 3:18 a.m. but was set back to working order by the application of a new battery, indicating the stoppage was due to battery failure, not necessarily a direct action of the thief. 

Lastly, the pocket watch stopped at 5:22 a.m., but as it was located far away from the area of break-in and was newly restored, the cause of its stoppage is also not directly connected to the thief's physical actions at that specific time.

Hence, the grandfather clock offers the most reliable timestamp for the burglar's presence in the shop.

However, “Perplexed Dog Walker” saw the littering happen at around one o'clock in the morning which conflicts with Smug’s locked gate situation. He may be the culprit as he could be trying to point fingers at everyone else, feeling safe behind his gate and assuming no one would suspect him. Furthermore, he brings up the idea of hiring more police, which is a way for him shift the focus towards the lack of police resources rather than on finding the specific individual responsible. His use of the word "smug" is quite apt for someone who thinks he can get away with such a crime. Also, he doesn't have a direct encounter with the litter unlike the other letter writers who do.

He may be the culprit as he could be trying to point fingers at everyone else, feeling safe behind his gate and assuming no one would suspect him. Furthermore, he brings up the idea of hiring more police, which is a way for him shift the focus towards the lack of police resources rather than on finding the specific individual responsible. His use of the word "smug" is quite apt for someone who thinks he can get away with such a crime. Also, he doesn\'t have a direct encounter with the litter unlike the other letter writers who do. Considering these points, it seems Smug in Suburbia is the likely culprit.\nSo as explained, the culprit is', ['Concerned Neighbor', 'Confused Commuter', 'Perplexed Dog Walker', 'Smug in Suburbia'])

The culprit seems to be Sam Wheeler, the chef. There are a few clues leading to this conclusion:

1. The jar of truffles indicated that the chef had used up two jars in one week, making a total of twelve orders, but the receipt from Horton only showed nine orders (three from the current day and six from last week), indicating that three orders were not accounted for. 

2. Sam was the one who confirmed that there could be absolutely no mistakes, that if a customer ordered a steak with truffle sauce and got one with mushrooms instead, it would either be a mistake or a crime.

3. The fact that Wheeler had never before cooked truffles due to it being a too expensive ingredient allowed for students could indicate that he may have used the opportunity to cook with and potentially serve these high-priced items outside of the restaurant, making a profit for himself.

4. Chef Sam Wheeler has the most control over the ingredients and can easily switch steak with mushrooms for steak with truffles without others noticing. The waiters and the cashier are mainly interacting with customers and rely on the chef to prepare the correct dishes.

The murderer in this scenario is Linda Eberlie. The evidence in the statement provided by Eberlie is seen to be the most suspicious one. She knew that Arthur Glendon had a revolver and where he kept it. Plus, she was also aware of the weight of the prop gun, so she would have noticed the difference if it had been switched.

In an attempt to throw suspicion off herself, she tried to suggest that the victim committed suicide in a bizarre and elaborate manner. But this explanation wasn't very plausible, it would have been nearly impossible for Stella Marlowe to have planned such an event.

Also, Eberlie had a strong motive. She was angry with Marlowe for stealing her boyfriend (Sam Watson), and she might have planned the murder as an act of revenge. By placing the real gun in a position where Sam would use it, she ensured that Sam would unwillingly become the murder weapon, further ruining the possibility of him moving on to another woman after Stella Marlow's death.

The murderer is Mrs. Fairbank. 

The evident proof comes from observing the drinks. Only four people at the party consumed drinks, and three of them picked a cocktail known as the grasshopper, including the victim, Mrs. Rhys. The only other person who drank something different was Mr. Rhys, implying that whoever prepared the drinks had planned to poison the people consuming grasshopper cocktails only, and Mr. Rhys revealed that there were only four people present, including himself and Mr. & Mrs. Fairbank.

The suspects were Mr. Rhys, Ian Fairbank, and Mrs. Fairbank. Mr. Rhys drank a different cocktail, which rules him out as he would have to poison himself to carry out the crime in the way explained. Then there's Ian Fairbank. However, it was revealed that he drank an almost empty glass, and if the poison was introduced through the cocktails, it would be improbable for him to stay unaffected.

So, the conclusion is that Mrs. Fairbank dabbed the poison in the cocktails. She had the fitting opportunity and the obvious awareness that her husband and son (Ian) were less likely to consume the cocktails, hence reducing any risks of accidentally poisoning them, while ensuring Mrs. Rhys would drink the poisoned cocktail and subsequently meet her end. Hence, Mrs. Fairbank is the murderer.

However, the janitor Pete Thompson had entered for cleaning without a record, which means it's possible for someone else to have entered too.

The murderer is Captain Kildare. He took a swing at Jensen earlier in the story, showing he may potentially have violent tendencies. Furthermore, the fact that he found the cracked oar and the blood stains suggests that he knew where to look, possibly because he put them there himself. He also determined Jensen's body was rowed out to sea and dumped, showing he knew more about the circumstances of the death than the average person might. Lastly, he shook his head in a grim manner at the idea that the body had drifted back to shore, which could suggest regret or a sense of failure for not committing the perfect crime. These clues suggest that Captain Kildare is the murderer.

The most likely person to have written the warning letter to the British is Smith. Throughout the story, he shows a distinct interest in trade, as well as a reasonable skepticism towards war. Furthermore, he is from Maine, a state known for its desire to secede, which illustrates his connections to the British. His dismissive comment on the war, saying, "Even if we are at war, money's money," paints him as someone who is willing to work with the British, even if it means betraying his own side.

The culprit is Lester Wellington, Lorraine's husband. 

There are several clues in the story that point out to him. Firstly, when Lester arrives at the scene, he seems completely unfazed by the presence of the police and instead jokes about them being his Valentine's gift. Secondly, he appears genuinely surprised and delighted upon hearing that he was supposed to receive a wristwatch as a gift, an oddly naive reaction for someone who would've stolen it. Lester is also responsible for looking after the estate, implying that he would have access to each part of it, including the cottage. 

However, the most decisive piece of evidence comes from the smashed vase. Lorraine has arthritis, which makes it hard for her to clutch a keyring, let alone smash a tough ceramic vase. Josie and her mother are dismissed since they had no motive to steal the wristwatch. Lastly, Cindy, the maid, said that there was nothing out of order in the guest cottage when she left it, so it leaves only Lester who could've had the physical ability to smash the vase and hide the evidence during the night. 

Furthermore, Lorraine mentions that Lester spends much of his time gambling. This potentially suggests a motive for Lester to have stolen the wristwatch. Despite living in a wealthy household, Lester might be in financial trouble due to his gambling habits. This theory is speculative but could potentially explain why he would steal an expensive item from his own household. 

To summarise, Lester is the only reasonable suspect based on the given information in the story.

The murderer is Tom Gooding. 

Although all persons interviewed had a possible motive, and most had stated that they interacted with Tim Randall at some point during the night of his murder, Tom Gooding was the last known person to see Tim alive. Tom's reason for not wanting to work with Tim due to the unethical nature of Tim's business activities seems plausible, but does not mean he couldn't have harbored hostile feelings towards him. His stated timings for the movie give him plausible deniability for the time of the murder but given the circumstantial evidence, he still can't be ruled out.

Tom Gooding claimed he had a conversation with Randall over dinner about joining his firm before Randall's murder, which makes him a strong suspect. Also, his statement about seeing a midnight movie was suspicious as it could be seen as an attempt to fabricate an alibi for the time of the murder. Randolph Johnson's, Sarah Conrad's and Morris Ingall's claims of their last interactions with Randall neither seem strong nor do they incline towards the motive. Therefore, based on his suspicious behaviour and proximity to the victim, the most likely suspect is Tom Gooding.

- He was in the computer lab shortly before he heard about the scheme.
- When asked about Simon Knowles, Barry seems to be in a mysterious silence, possibly pretending not to know him.
- He defensively argues about the possibility of hacking into the voting system, indicating his detailed knowledge of the matter.
- Finally, he separates from Amy to "watch for the hacker," possibly attempting to conduct his plan.

It's also suspicious how quickly he found information on Ricky Churrelo and Xavier Ericksen but dismissed Simon Knowles – perhaps a diversion tactic.

Tony being the older and more independent of the siblings, would be more likely to do something like this. Also, while Leslie was very attentive to Ross and his bee sting, Tony was instructed to go downstairs. This gave him the opportunity to sneak a cupcake.

The murderer is Mr. James Castro. There are several key points that lead to this conclusion:

1) The saliva found on the gun matches Mr. Castro. It could not have been a forensics error as Detective Bachmann suggested, because the chances of a saliva sample accidentally matching someone else's is astronomically low.

2) The height disparity also raises suspicion. Given the information provided, Mr. Shelby was shot from a higher angle as he was kneeling - which Mr. Castro’s height could account for. 

3) The location of Mr. Castro's room is also crucial. Mr. Castro was in 21b, which was directly under the victim's room, 22b. He could have shot Mr. Shelby from the window below if he maneuvered himself properly and being a former swimming instructor, he might have had the necessary agility to do so.

4) Mr. Castro also arrived at the scene looking weary and suspicious. His account of whereabouts also don't add up, it's doubtful he was merely strolling along the beach in the middle of the night.

5) His newly bought, unused clothes suggest that he tried to get rid of whatever he was wearing at the time of the murder. 

6) Mrs. Shelby's claim that she felt something was wrong further adds to the suspicion against Mr. Castro. She may have been vaguely aware of a third person’s presence (Mr. Castro) during her argument with her husband. 

7) The fact that Mr. Castro was nowhere to be found on the day of the murder until midnight despite being a suspect furthers suspicion. The hallways cameras may agree with his alibi, but the rest of his actions and evidence weight against him. 

As such, all evidence points to Mr. Castro being the murderer.
The suspects are Dianne Shelby,James Castro,Kevin King,Roger Shelby

The thief in this case is Ricky. Mr. Kahilua mentioned the theft occurred about a half hour prior to the detectives' arrival. Ricky arrived at the house 10 minutes before the detectives, and Ricky said it takes about 30 minutes to drive between the houses. If Ricky drove from his house to Kahilua's after the theft, he should've arrived later. His timing doesn't match up, implying he was already at Kahilua's when the book disappeared. Furthermore, he didn't have an alibi for the time of theft. Therefore, Ricky is the thief.

The culprit is Uncle Henry. 

Here's how we deduce it:

1. We know that the thief is an adult based on the conversation the children have.

2. The maid has been ruled out because she's not allowed in the room.

3. The father has an alibi of being with the mother post supper while the theft occurred.

4. The children's observation about their dad limping suggests that it isn't an old injury and was a result of that night. Which implies that the father doesn't know who had entered their room.

5. The to-be-thief must have enough access to the house to know where the safe is, as well as enough intimacy to know the secret keyhole behind the old mysterious hole which is around four feet from the ground in the living room.

6. Uncle Henry is seen trying to reach into the hole in the wall where the key is hidden, indicating he knows about the secret key's location.

7. We also know that the key hole is large and the lock cannot be picked except by an expert finger, Uncle Henry's finger fits precisely into the hole. Aunt Mary's finger is too thick to fit, ruling her out.

8. The height of the safe eliminates Aunt Mary and Uncle John, who is hinted at being similar in build to the child narrator, making it unlikely that he could reach the safe at five and a half feet high.

9. The footprints under the bed are smaller, eliminating father and Uncle John with his "awfully large feet". Uncle Henry being described as short further supports the smaller size footprints. 

Thus, the clues point to Uncle Henry.
The suspects are Aunt Mary,Dad,Mom,Uncle Henry,Uncle John

The culprit is Carson Thomson. Despite claiming to have left his wallet on the table after paying for his meal, he happened to mention that he "laid down a dollar-twenty tip". Given the time period (where credit card payments were not common) he would have needed his wallet to pay for the meal and subsequently leave the tip. The fact that he was able to tip indicates that he still had his wallet after leaving the restaurant. Therefore, it can be inferred that he misplaced his wallet somewhere else or is attempting a blame game.
