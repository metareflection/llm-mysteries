## STORY


The story is intriguing and captivating. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. Now, to find the culprit, let's analyze the information provided.

1. Gordon: Gordon is a farmer who has a history of conflict with Harry, as he believed that Harry's success was due to favoritism and led to a decline in his sales. However, he doesn't seem to have any personal vendetta against Harry, and his alibi of being on his farm during the time of the murder seems legitimate.
2. Dexter: Dexter is a close friend of Harry's and has a strong interest in hunting. He has a collection of bear traps, one of which was used to kill Harry. He also has a motive, as Harry had publicly mocked his faith. However, Dexter's friendly demeanor and willingness to cooperate with the investigation suggest that he

I can certainly help you with that. Based on the information provided, it seems like both Kimberly and Lillian have motives and opportunities to commit the crime. However, there are some details that point more strongly towards Lillian as the culprit.

Firstly, Lillian has a history of sneaking out at night, which suggests that she may have had the opportunity to obtain the poisonous frog without being detected. Additionally, her interest in amphibians and her expertise in their toxins make it more plausible that she could extract the poison from the frog and use it to kill Jamal.

Furthermore, Lillian's motive for the crime seems stronger than Kimberly's. Lillian stood to gain a significant amount of power and influence as Jamal's successor, and she had a personal connection to him as his goddaughter. It
