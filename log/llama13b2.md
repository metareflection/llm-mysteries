The fact that the fire escape is broken and the window is closed but unlocked suggests that the manager may have entered Dillon's apartment through the window and taken the saxophone.

Eric, the college student, may have inadvertently tipped off the thief by visiting Red's music store, but he is not the culprit.

2. Lincoln is described as a likable person, which could be a way of distracting from his involvement in the theft.
3. Lincoln mentioned that he checked the desk drawers to make sure they were locked, which could be a way of planting the idea that he was in the office and had access to the money.
4. Lincoln is the only one who mentioned an electronic paper trail, which could be a way of trying to cover his tracks.

Okay, so we know that the film "Attack of the 50 Foot Woman" is missing, and we know that all of the grandsons were in the house and had access to the film collection. We also know that Jack is mildly annoyed but not mad, which suggests that he doesn't suspect any of them of doing something malicious.
So, let's think about each of the grandsons and their potential motivations for taking the film.
Andy, the 13-year-old, might have taken the film because he's a horror fan like his grandfather and wanted to watch it himself. However, he's already been showering and changing clothes, so it's unlikely he would go back upstairs to retrieve the film.
Matthew, the 11-year-old, might have taken the film because he

2. When Marie asked who took the ornament, Mike was the one who admitted to taking it.
3. The story states that Mike looked very childlike as he distributed the gifts, which suggests that he might have been tempted to take the ornament.

The culprit is... Rachel Beaton!
Here's why:
1. The footprint found at the scene matches Rachel's shoe size.
2. Rachel was the only one who had a valid alibi for the time of the crime (she was passed out at a bar).
3. Bill confirmed that Rachel was at the bar the night before, which supports her alibi.
4. Rachel had a motive to commit the crime, as she was a wheat farmer and Frank was a rival farmer.
5. The fact that Rachel was "indisposed" the night before and couldn't remember what she did, suggests that she may have been under the influence of alcohol and not fully aware of her actions.

Therefore, based on the evidence and the detective's analysis, Rachel Beaton is the most likely culprit.
The suspects are Bill Albertson,Mr. Fletcher,Professor Surenie,Rachel Beaton

I can definitely help you solve this mystery! Based on the information provided, here's my analysis of the potential culprits:
