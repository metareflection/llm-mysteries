<s>[INST]Cole is on the varsity basketball team. Is Cole over 6 feet tall? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Cole is under 7 feet tall. 
2. Every player on Cole's varsity basketball team is above 6'1".

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Here's the reasoning:

1. Statement 1: Cole is under 7 feet tall. This option only gives us an upper limit for Cole's height. He could be anywhere from just under 7 feet to 0 inches tall, so we can't determine if he's over 6 feet based on this information. Thus, statement 1 alone is insufficient.
2. Statement 2: Every player on Cole's varsity basketball team is above 6'1". Since this is a statement about all players on the team, it doesn't provide any information about Cole's height specifically. Thus, statement 2 alone is insufficient.
3. Combining both statements still doesn't give us enough information to determine Cole's height since neither statement provides a lower limit. If Cole is one of the shorter players on the team, he could still be under 6 feet tall, and if he's one of the taller players, he could be over 6 feet tall.

The correct answer is (E): Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

<s>[INST]Does Alice like elephants more than zebras? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Elephants are Alice's favourite animals. 
2. Zebras are the animals that Alice likes the least.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
1. If elephants are Alice's favorite animals, this means that she likes elephants more than some other animals (but not necessarily all other animals). We don't know her feelings towards zebras based solely on statement 1.
2. If zebras are the animals that Alice likes the least, this still doesn't give us any information about how she feels towards elephants.

Evaluating the options:
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient. INCORRECT. Statement 1 alone is insufficient, and statement 2 alone is also insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient. INCORRECT. Statement 1 alone is insufficient, and statement 2 alone is also insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient. INCORRECT. Neither statement alone is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient. INCORRECT. Neither statement alone is sufficient, and taken together, they still don't provide enough information.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient. CORRECT. Neither statement alone is sufficient, and taken together, they still don't provide enough information.

Therefore, the correct option is (E). The question cannot be answered with the given statements or taken together.

<s>[INST]All the students in a classroom wrote an exam. How many students are in the classroom? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Five students failed. 
2. One student was 29th from the top and 16th from the bottom.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Here's why:

Statement 1 tells us that five students failed, but it doesn't tell us how many students there are in the classroom total. It's possible that the number of students in the classroom could be inferred from a combination of these statements if we knew the total number of students and the number that passed, but statement 2 doesn't provide enough information about the ranking of the students to let us determine this.

Statement 2 tells us that one student was 29th from the top and 16th from the bottom. But knowing this doesn't help us determine the total number of students, because the difference between the highest and lowest rankings could correspond to any number of students.

Since neither statement provides enough information on its own, and neither statement can be combined with the other to provide enough information, neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together are sufficient to determine the total number of students in the classroom.

<s>[INST]Which direction is Samuel facing in? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Samuel is not facing North. 
2. Samuel is facing the sun.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
To solve this problem, let's consider each statement individually and then both together:

1. Samuel is not facing North: This information alone is not enough to determine which direction Samuel is facing; it could be any of the other three directions - East, South, or West.
2. Samuel is facing the sun: Depending on the time of day, the position of the sun changes. However, even with this knowledge, we cannot pinpoint which direction Samuel is facing. For example, at sunrise the sun is in the East, so if Samuel is facing the sunrise, he faces East. But if it's noon, the sun is generally in the South in the Northern Hemisphere, so if Samuel is facing the sun, he faces South.

Together, these statements still don't provide sufficient information. Even if we know Samuel isn't facing North and he's facing the sun, we cannot determine his exact direction without more information about the time or location.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E): Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
The correct answer is: (E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Here's the reasoning:

1. Statement 1: "There are no red balls in the basket." This statement does not provide enough information to determine if all the balls in the basket are blue. There might be balls of other colors as well.
2. Statement 2: "The smallest ball in the basket is green." This statement also does not provide enough information to determine if all the balls in the basket are blue because the color of the smallest ball doesn't indicate the color of all the other balls.
3. Taken together, these statements still don't provide enough information to conclude that there are only blue balls in the basket since neither statement excludes the possibility of other colors.

Hence, we need more information to determine if there are only blue balls in the basket.

<s>[INST]Does Leonid like carrots? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Leonid hates vegetables. 
. Leonid prefers carrots to leeks.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A

1. Statement 1: Leonid hates vegetables.
2. Statement 2: Leonid prefers carrots to leeks.

Choice (A) says that statement 1 alone is sufficient, but statement 2 is not. Choice (B) says that statement 2 alone is sufficient, but statement 1 is not. Choice (C) says that either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient. Choice (D) says that both statements are needed. Choice (E) says that neither statement is sufficient alone or together.

If Leonid hates vegetables, as in statement 1, then it is unlikely that he likes carrots, as they are a vegetable. Statement 1 would be sufficient, making choice (A) the correct answer.

Statement 2, saying that Leonid prefers carrots to leeks, may indicate that he likes both, only carrots, or carrots better than leeks but still dislikes both. Without more information, this statement is insufficient on its own.

Therefore, choice (A) is the correct option. Once we determine from statement 1 that Leonid hates vegetables, there is no need to consider statement 2. However, I will analyze statement 2 in the context of statement 1 to demonstrate its insufficiency.

In combination, statements 1 and 2 together would indicate that Leonid dislikes vegetables, but prefers carrots to leeks. Since carrots are a vegetable, this would imply that Leonid dislikes leeks more than carrots but still dislikes both. This reinforces statement 1, but statement 2 remains insufficient on its own.

The order in which I considered the statements allowed me to answer the question with less information. However, I examined both statements combined to fully demonstrate choice (D) as incorrect. By thinking step by step, I was able to determine the correct answer to be choice (A).

2. Probability of either A or B or both A and B happening is 0.65.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
The probability of event B occurring can be found by subtracting the probability of event A from the probability of either A or B or both A and B happening, assuming events A and B are mutually exclusive (they cannot occur at the same time). 

1. Probability of event A is 0.55. This statement alone is not sufficient because it only gives information about the probability of event A, not event B.
2. Probability of either A or B or both A and B happening is 0.65. This statement alone is not sufficient because it doesn't give specific information about the probability of event B.

However, when taken together, it is possible to find the answer. 

Subtracting the probability of event A from the probability of either A or B gives us the probability of event B:

P(B) = P(A or B) - P(A) = 0.65 - 0.55 = 0.10

Therefore, the correct option is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

<s>[INST]Will the building contractor need a special license? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
. All buildings with more than 20 floors need a special license. 
 The building contractor wants to build a 30-storey building.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

We can determine this by considering each statement individually:

Statement 1: All buildings with more than 20 floors need a special license. This statement only provides information about the requirement for buildings with more than 20 floors. It does not provide enough information about the specific building contractor's project.

Statement 2: The building contractor wants to build a 30-storey building. This statement only provides information about the building contractor's project intentions. It does not provide any information about licensing requirements for building projects.

However, when considered together, it can be inferred that because the contractor wants to build a 30-storey building (statement 2), and all buildings with more than 20 floors need a special license (statement 1), then the building contractor will need a special license. Thus, either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient to determine that the building contractor will need a special license.

<s>[INST]A wall is built in 6 hours by 10 men. How long will it take for 5 brick-laying machines to build the wall? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. If 5 brick-laying machines work with 5 men the wall will be built in 7.5 hours. 
2. The brick-laying machines work twice as fast as the men.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
First, let's analyze Statement 1: "If 5 brick-laying machines work with 5 men the wall will be built in 7.5 hours."

From this statement, we can see that the brick-laying machines are not as efficient as the men because the wall is built more slowly (in 7.5 hours) when there are 5 machines working with 5 men as compared to when there are only 10 men working (which takes 6 hours).

The relationship between the number of men and machines is irrelevant since the question asks for the time needed for 5 machines to build the wall alone. The information given in Statement 1 is not helpful in determining the time needed for 5 machines to build a wall.

Now, let's analyze Statement 2: "The brick-laying machines work twice as fast as the men."

This statement indicates that a single machine is as efficient as 2 men. Consequently, 5 brick-laying machines would have a collective efficiency equal to 10 men. Since the wall takes 6 hours for 10 men to build, it would also take 6 hours for 5 machines to build the wall due to their collective efficiency being equal to that of 10 men.

Statement 2 is sufficient to answer the question.

The correct option is (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

2. The sum of the number of people in Ramya's restaurant and Abhinav's restaurant is equal to 70.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
1. Statement 1 alone is not sufficient: It just tells us that Abhinav's restaurant has less people than Ramya's, but it doesn't give us an exact number for Ramya's restaurant.
2. Statement 2 alone is sufficient: If we know the sum of the number of people in both restaurants, and we know the number of people in Abhinav's restaurant (from statement 1), then we can subtract those two numbers to find the number of people in Ramya's restaurant.

So, the correct answer is (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

<s>[INST]Who finished the task in the least amount of time between Liam, Pranav and Salma? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?

2 Salma takes double the amount of time that Pranav and Liam take working together.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
To determine who finished the task in the least amount of time, we need to compare the time taken by Liam, Pranav, and Salma to complete the task.

Statement 1: Liam takes as much time as Salma and Pranav would take if they worked together.

This statement does not give us enough information to determine who finished the task in the least amount of time. It only tells us that Liam's time is equal to the combined time of Salma and Pranav.

Statement 2: Salma takes double the amount of time that Pranav and Liam take working together.

This statement also does not give us enough information to determine who finished the task in the least amount of time. It only tells us the relationship between Salma's time and the combined time of Pranav and Liam.

However, when we consider both statements together, we can arrive at the answer. From statement 1, we know that Liam's time is equal to the combined time of Salma and Pranav. From statement 2, we know that Salma's time is double the combined time of Pranav and Liam. Since Salma's time is double Liam's time, and Liam's time is equal to the combined time of Salma and Pranav, it implies that Pranav must have taken the least amount of time to complete the task.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
Given answer: D

1. There are fewer girls than boys. 
2. Each girl has half as many sisters as brothers.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
1. From statement 1 alone, we know that there are fewer girls than boys, but we don't know the exact number of each. This statement doesn't give us specific information, so we can't determine the exact number of boys. Insufficient.

2. From statement 2 alone, each girl has half as many sisters as brothers. Since there are 7 children in total, if we assume there is just one girl, she would have half as many sisters as brothers, which means there would be 2 boys. But if we assume two girls, then the number of boys wouldn't divide evenly by 2, and so on. The only way for the equation to work is if there are 4 girls and 3 boys. Statement 2 is sufficient.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Explanation:

From statement 1, Qi's birthday is narrowed down to a range of dates between 3rd and 4th March, which is sufficient to answer the question as we now have a specific range for Qi's birthday.

Statement 2 is insufficient because Brenna's statement is incorrect, implying that we cannot rely on her statement to determine the correct range for Qi's birthday. Thus, statement 2 doesn't help us in finding the answer.

Since statement 1 provides enough information to determine Qi's birthday, we don't need to consider statement 2. Therefore, option (A) would be the correct answer.

Correct answer: B
From statement 1 alone, we cannot determine whether Alexia is a doctor. It only tells us that either Alexia or Jenny is a doctor, but we don't know which one.

From statement 2 alone, we can determine that Alexia is a doctor. Since it states that Alexia and Jenny are a doctor and nurse respectively, this means that Alexia must be the doctor.

Therefore, statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question, and statement 1 is insufficient. The correct answer is (B).

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
To determine if there will be more crocodile attacks next year, we would need to know if there is a continuing trend or if there are factors that could contribute to an increase or decrease in attacks.

Statement 1: There were more crocodile attacks this year than last year. This statement only provides information about the number of attacks this year compared to last year, but it doesn't give any insight into the number of attacks next year. Statement 1 alone is insufficient (A is correct).

Statement 2: 56 people were attacked by crocodiles this year. This statement gives information about the number of attacks this year, but it doesn't provide any context about whether this is a typical or atypical number of attacks. It also doesn't provide information about the number of attacks in previous years or any trends that might indicate whether there will be more attacks next year. Statement 2 alone is insufficient (B is correct).

Either statement 1 or statement 2 is insufficient on its own, but taken together, they still do not provide enough information to determine if there will be more crocodile attacks next year. Statement 1 provides information about the trend in attacks from last year to this year, but it doesn't provide enough context to determine if this trend will continue. Statement 2 provides information about the number of attacks this year, but it doesn't provide any information about the trend in attacks or any factors that could contribute to an increase or decrease in attacks next year.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

[/INST]


Correct answer: E
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

The number of African member states in the United Nations in 1999 is not directly related to either the nationality of the UN Secretary General or the amount of UN aid received by African countries in 1998. Therefore, neither statement 1 nor statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question. Moreover, neither statement provides information about the size of the African group in the UN in 1999, so using both statements together is still insufficient to determine the answer.

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
The question asks for the value of x and gives us two statements. We will analyze each statement and its ability to give us the value of x.

1. x = 3
This statement explicitly gives us the value of x as 3. It is sufficient to determine the value of x.

2. x = x
This statement is an identity, which is always true, regardless of the value of x. It does not provide enough information to find a specific value for x.

By examining the statements individually:
Statement 1 alone is sufficient to answer the question, so we combine it with (A), (C), and (D).
Statement 2 alone is not sufficient to answer the question, so we eliminate (B) and (C).
By combining both statements, it still does not provide additional information to find the value of x, and we already know statement 1 is sufficient on its own.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) - Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Correct answer: D
The correct option is (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Explanation: As per statement 2, our city has 150 beds per thousand people. This number exceeds the minimum number of beds (100 per thousand people) mentioned in statement 1. Thus, statement 2 alone is sufficient to determine that our city has enough beds for patients. Statement 1 alone cannot provide an accurate answer because it only provides a minimum requirement, without any reference to the actual population size or existing number of beds in our city.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
Let's evaluate the statements:

1. Student X got 7 questions correct.

We don't know the total number of questions, so it might be that 7 out of 10 questions is sufficient for a 70% passing grade, but it could also be that there are 9 or more questions, in which case 7 correct answers would be insufficient. Therefore, statement 1 alone is not sufficient.

2. Student X got all the questions correct.

If Student X got all the questions correct, then the only way for them to not achieve a 70% or higher is if the total number of questions is fewer than 10. Since this scenario assumes they got all questions correct, they would have more than 70% if the total number of questions is 10 or more. Therefore, statement 2 alone is sufficient.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

<s>[INST]Is circle A smaller than circle B? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. The area of circle B is two times the area of circle A. 
2. The radius of circle B is less than the radius of circle A.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
Statement 1: Area of circle B is two times the area of circle A. This implies that the radius of circle B is greater than the radius of circle A because the area of a circle is proportional to the square of its radius (A = πr^2). So, if the area of circle B is twice that of circle A, then the radius of circle B must be greater than the radius of circle A, which means circle B is larger than circle A. Therefore, statement 1 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2: The radius of circle B is less than the radius of circle A. This directly tells us that circle A has a larger radius than circle B, which means circle A is larger than circle B. Therefore, statement 2 alone is also sufficient to answer the question.

As both statements 1 and 2 are sufficient on their own, the correct option is:

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
Given answer: C


<s>[INST]Neha looks at a cup of water and says “This cup is more than half full.” Vighnesh looks at it and says, “No, it’s at least half empty.” Who is right?
Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. You are allowed to pour water out of the cup into a measuring cylinder or any other container.
2. You are allowed to use a ruler or measuring tape.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (F) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(F). The question can be answered without either statement.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: F
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

If you are allowed to pour the water into a measuring cylinder (statement 1), you can determine whether the cup is more than half full or at least half empty by comparing the volume of the water to the capacity of the cup.

If you are allowed to use a ruler or measuring tape (statement 2), you can measure the height of the water in the cup against the height of the cup itself. If the height of the water is more than half the height of the cup, then the cup is more than half full; if it's less than or equal to half, then the cup is at least half empty.

Therefore, either statement allows you to answer the question without needing the other.

<s>[INST]Can Bill afford to buy more $50 pots for his garden? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Bill's gardening budget is $300 and he has spent some of the budget. 
. Bill has only spent his budget on 7 plants that cost $40 each.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
Statement 1: Bill's gardening budget is $300 and he has spent some of the budget.
This statement only tells us that Bill has a budget of $300 and he has spent an unknown amount, so it's not clear if Bill can afford to buy more $50 pots. Information about what Bill has spent his budget on is needed. 

Statement 2: Bill has only spent his budget on 7 plants that cost $40 each.
This statement tells us exactly how much Bill has spent ($40 x 7 = $280) which means he has $20 left in his budget.

From Statement 2 we can deduce that Bill can afford to buy more $50 pots because his remaining budget is $20 and the pots cost $50 each. Since Statement 2 is sufficient alone, the answer is:

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: B


<s>[INST]How is Tim related to Justin? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Justin's sister's father's son is Tim. 
2. Justin is Tim's brother's father-in-law's only daughter's brother-in-law.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
Let's break down the relations given in the statements:

Statement 1: "Justin's sister's father's son is Tim." This simplifies to "Tim is the son of Justin's sister's father," which means that Tim is Justin's nephew. So, statement 1 is sufficient.

Statement 2: "Justin is Tim's brother's father-in-law's only daughter's brother-in-law." If we break this down, it becomes "Tim's brother's wife's father is Justin." Rearranging, we get "Justin is the husband of Tim's sister." This means that Justin is Tim's brother-in-law. This is a different relationship than stated in option A, but it still shows a relationship between Tim and Justin, so statement 2 is also sufficient.

However, since both statements independently provide sufficient information, we do not need to consider taking them together. So, the correct answer choice is (C), either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
Given answer: C


<s>[INST]Is x a prime number? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. x is divisible by the factors of 10. 
2. x is greater than 13.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that has only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.

Let's examine each statement individually:

1. If x is divisible by the factors of 10, then it has more than two distinct positive divisors. The factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10. Therefore, statement 1 is insufficient because x cannot be a prime number if it has more than two distinct positive divisors.

2. If x is greater than 13, this does not give us any specific information about the number of factors x has. It could still have more than two distinct positive divisors, which would make it not a prime number. But it also could be a prime number larger than 13. For example, x could be 17, which is a prime number. So statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Let's now examine both statements together:

Since statement 1 tells us that x has more than two distinct positive divisors, we know that x cannot be a prime number based solely on statement 1. Therefore, even when combining both statements, we do not have sufficient information to confirm that x is a prime number.

Thus, the correct answer choice is (E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
Given answer: E


<s>[INST]How many people in Maria's office read the newspaper? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Half the people in the office don't read the newspaper. 
2. 10% of the people in Maria's office read the newspaper.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
1. Half the people in the office don't read the newspaper. We can't determine the exact number of people who read the newspaper based on this statement, because we don't know the total number of people in Maria's office. So statement 1 alone is insufficient.
2. 10% of the people in Maria's office read the newspaper. This statement also does not give us the exact number of people who read the newspaper, because again, we don't know the total number of people in Maria's office. So statement 2 alone is insufficient.

However, if we combine both statements:

If half the people in the office don't read the newspaper, it means the other half does. So if 10% of the people in Maria's office read the newspaper, then that means 10% of the office is the half that does read the newspaper. Since we know that 10% of the group corresponds to the half that reads the newspaper, we can now calculate the exact number of people who read the newspaper by finding the total number of people in the office. Therefore, either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient when taken together, so the correct answer is (C).
Given answer: C

1. Komal is neither the tallest nor the shortest. 
2. Rita is only taller than Kathy and Komal.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
1. Komal is neither the tallest nor the shortest. This statement tells us that Rachel and Rita are taller than Komal. But we cannot determine who the third tallest is. So, statement 1 alone is insufficient.

2. Rita is only taller than Kathy and Komal. This statement tells us that Rachel is taller than Rita, making Rachel the tallest. Rita is taller than Kathy and Komal leaving only one position left for Rita to be the third tallest. So, statement 2 alone is sufficient.

Therefore, the correct option is (B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

1. x is an even number. 
3. The square root of x is greater than 4.

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
1. If x is an even number, then by definition, x is divisible by 2. So, statement 1 alone is sufficient.
2. The square root of x is greater than 4 implies that x is greater than 16 (since squaring 4 gives 16). However, x could be an odd number greater than 16, in which case it would not be divisible by 2. Alternatively, x could be any multiple of 2 greater than 16, in which case it would be divisible by 2. Since statement 2 does not consistently indicate whether or not x is divisible by 2, statement 2 alone is insufficient.
3. However, since statement 1 alone is sufficient, we do not need to consider the combination of statements 1 and 2.

The correct answer is (A): Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

2. Qi will be 23 years old in 5 years.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
1. Five years ago, Qi's age was half of her current age.
2. Qi will be 23 years old in 5 years.

Let's analyze each statement:

1. If Qi's age was half her current age 5 years ago, it means that her age increases by 100% every 5 years. This is a pattern of growth, but not an actual age. So we cannot find Qi's age with just this information. Therefore, statement 1 is insufficient.
2. If Qi will be 23 years old in 5 years, then we can find her current age by subtracting 5 from 23, which gives us 18. Now that we have a specific age, we can work backwards to see if statement 1 is true. Five years ago, Qi would have been 18 - 5 = 13 years old, and half of 13 is not equal to 18/2 (which would be Qi's current age), so statement 1 is not true. Therefore, statement 2 is sufficient on its own.

Answer: (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Correct answer: E
1. From statement 1, we know that Tony's birthday is during a three-day period: 17th, 18th, or 19th March.
2. From statement 2, we know that Tony's birthday is not on 20th March.
3. Thus, when combining both statements, we have no discrepancy or additional information that would alter our conclusion from Statement 1 alone.

The correct answer is (A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient, but statement 2 is not necessary to answer the question.

1. Each cowshed contains one cow. 
2. There are at least 60 cows.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
1. Each cowshed contains one cow.
2. There are at least 60 cows.

From statement 1 alone, since each of the 50 cowsheds contains one cow, there are 50 cows on the farm. Therefore, statement 1 is sufficient on its own.

From statement 2 alone, since there are at least 60 cows, and there are only 50 cowsheds, this statement is incorrect, thus it cannot be sufficient.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Correct answer: F
The correct option is (F). The question can be answered without either statement.

In badminton, the outcome of a best-of-three-games match does not necessarily depend on physical stamina or current ranking. Even if Saina Nehwal has more physical stamina or is ranked higher than P.V. Sindhu, she could still lose the first game and then the match, as there are many other factors that can influence the outcome such as skill level, strategy, mental strength, and current form.

Therefore, neither statement 1 nor statement 2 is necessary to answer the question, as the answer can be derived from the information provided in the question itself.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
To answer the question "Are some PQRs also XYZs?" we need to find a connection between PQR and XYZ. 

Let's examine the statements:

1. Some XYZs are ABCs.
2. Some XYZs are PQRs.

Answer:

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Explanation:
Statement 1 does not provide any information about a possible relationship between PQR and XYZ. So, statement 1 alone is not sufficient.

Statement 2 tells us that some XYZs are PQRs, but this doesn't answer the question of whether some PQRs are XYZs. This statement alone is also not sufficient.

Together, statements 1 and 2 still do not provide enough information to determine if some PQRs are XYZs. Statement 1 only talks about XYZs being ABCs, not about PQRs. Statement 2 tells us that some XYZs are PQRs, but it doesn't confirm whether they are a subset of XYZs that are also ABCs (from statement 1). Therefore, neither statement nor both statements taken together are sufficient.

[/INST]


Correct answer: C
The correct option is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Statement 1 alone is not sufficient because we do not know if Alina has access to this book. Statement 2 alone is not sufficient because even though we know Alina has access to this book, we do not know if it is an adventure book. However, when we take both statements together, we can conclude that since Alina was offered only adventure and mystery books and "Under the Sun" is not a mystery book, it must be an adventure book. Therefore, Alina will want to read "Under the Sun".

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
1. Statement 1 tells us that Betty answered False, so if the correct answer was False, then it would be sufficient to say that Betty got it wrong. However, we don't know if that's the case, so statement 1 alone is not enough.
2. Statement 2 does not provide any information about the question or Betty's answer, so it cannot be sufficient alone.
3. Since statement 1 provides some information, but isn't sufficient, we can't rule out the possibility that either statement 1 or statement 2 could be sufficient. However, we already determined that statement 1 is not sufficient, so now we must check if statement 2 is sufficient.
4. Since statement 2 does not provide enough information to determine the correct answer (we don't even know what the question was!), it is also not sufficient on its own.
5. When both statements are considered together, we still do not have enough information to accurately determine the correct answer. This is because we do not know if Betty answered False for the specific question in question or if it was another question entirely that Betty answered incorrectly.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
2 - (A, B, C)
Let's analyze the statements:

1. The difference in the marks obtained by T and U is eleven. U got the highest marks. This statement only gives us information about T and U, not S and V.
2. The difference in the marks obtained by S and T is fifteen and the difference in the marks obtained by U and V is nine. This statement provides the differences between S&T and U&V. Since we know U has the highest marks, we can find the marks of S and V.

From statement 2, if U is the highest, then T = U-11, S = T-15, and V = U-9. So, S = U-11-15, and V = U-9. Therefore, S-V = U-11-15 - (U-9) = -26 + U - U + 9 = -17.

Thus, statement 2 is sufficient to determine the difference in marks between S and V, while statement 1 is not.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
Let's analyze the given statements:

1. E is sitting to the right of H.
2. F is sitting opposite to H.

If F is sitting opposite to H, then G and the fourth player (let's call him/her I) must be sitting opposite each other as well. Since there are only four players, this means that E must also be sitting opposite to one of the players.

Now, let's consider Statement 1: E is sitting to the right of H. This statement would only be true if H is sitting at the corner of the board. If H is at a corner, then since F is opposite to H, F must be at the diagonally opposite corner. As a result, E, who is to the right of H, must be sitting adjacent to F. This leaves only one position for G, which is the remaining corner opposite I.

Therefore, from Statement 1 alone, we can determine who G is sitting opposite to (I). Hence, Statement 1 is sufficient.

Statement 2 is also sufficient for determining who G is sitting opposite to since it directly gives us this information.

Since both statements provide enough information to answer the question, either of them could be used individually to determine who G is sitting opposite to. Therefore, the correct answer is:
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

From Statement 1, R is the niece of P. This means that P is either the sibling or sibling-in-law of one of R's parents. Q is the brother of R, so if P is a sibling of one of R's parents, then Q would be a nephew of P. However, if P is a sibling-in-law of one of R's parents, then Q's relationship to P may not be as clear. In order to determine Q's relationship to R, we need more information about P.

From Statement 2, S has one sister R. This means that S and R are siblings. We can use this information to see if it helps us determine the relationship between Q and R.

Taken together, the two statements suggest that S, R, and Q are all siblings or siblings-in-law. If we assume that P is a sibling (rather than a sibling-in-law) of one of R's parents, then this means that Q and R are siblings, and the answer is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

However, if we do not assume that P is a sibling of one of R's parents, then it is possible that Q and R are cousins (if P is a sibling of one of Q's parents). Therefore, we cannot definitively determine the relationship between Q and R based on the two statements alone.

The answer is (E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
Given answer: D


<s>[INST]How many ants in total are in this room? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Only black ants can be found indoors.
2. There are seven red ants in this room.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

This is because Statement 1 only gives information about the type of ants found indoors, but not their quantity. Statement 2 only tells us the number of red ants, leaving out any information about black ants. Since we have no way to determine the number of black ants, we cannot use either statement to find the total number of ants.

Taking both statements together, we still don't have enough information to find the total number of ants, as we only know the number of red ants, not the number of black ants. Thus, neither statement nor the combination of both are sufficient to answer the question.
Given answer: E


<s>[INST]What time does the clock show? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. The hour hand is between 5 and 6.
2. The clock shows a quarter past five.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
1. The hour hand is between 5 and 6.
2. The clock shows a quarter past five.

If the hour hand is between 5 and 6, it means the time is after 5 but not 6 yet. The smallest such time would be a quarter past five, so statement 2 is sufficient. 

However, statement 1 is not sufficient because the hour hand could be pointing between 5 and 6 at 15 minutes past five, 30 minutes past five, or any time up until 5:59. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: B


<s>[INST]P is towards which direction of Q? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Q is to the north of R, who is to the west of P.
2. P is to the north-west of S.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
1. Q is to the north of R, who is to the west of P.
2. P is to the north-west of S.

From statement 1, we know that Q is to the north of R and R is to the west of P. However, we don't have any information about the direction of P with respect to Q.

From statement 2, we know that P is to the north-west of S, but this statement doesn't provide any information about the direction of Q with respect to P or R.

Considering both statements together, we can't create a straight line between P and Q because we don't have enough information about their directions relative to each other. Thus, neither statement nor both statements together are sufficient to determine the direction of P from Q.

The correct answer is (E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
Given answer: E

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D

Let's analyze the given statements:

1. B has two brothers Nishant and Arav.
2. A's father is the brother of Arav's mother.

From statement 1, we can only conclude that A is related to Nishant and Arav, but we cannot determine how A is related to B. So, statement 1 alone is insufficient (A).

From statement 2, we can deduce that A's father and Arav's mother are siblings, which means A's father is B's uncle. Therefore, A is B's cousin. However, this statement does not provide any information about Nishant and Arav, so it is also insufficient on its own (B).

When considering both statements together, we know that A is B's cousin and that Nishant and Arav are B's brothers. However, the relationship between A and B's brothers is not explicitly stated. 

We need more information to establish a direct relationship between A and B or between A and one of B's brothers. Since none of the given options cover this scenario, the correct answer is:
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
Given answer: A


<s>[INST]What time does the bus leave for the airport today? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Buses usually depart on time.
2. The scheduled arrival is at 11:40 a.m.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Explanation:

Statement 1 tells us that buses usually depart on time. This means that if we know the scheduled departure time, we can assume that the bus will leave at that time. However, this doesn't directly answer the question "What time does the bus leave for the airport today?" Therefore, statement 1 alone is not sufficient.

Statement 2 gives us the scheduled arrival time at the airport. While this doesn't directly tell us the departure time, it does provide enough information to determine the answer if combined with common sense knowledge about how long it typically takes to get to the airport and prepare for departure. For example, if it takes an hour to travel to the airport and board the bus, then the bus must leave at 10:40 a.m. to arrive at 11:40 a.m.

Therefore, statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question. It's also possible that both statements together could be used to answer the question, but statement 2 alone is sufficient, so there is no need to consider statement 1 in conjunction with statement 2.

Thus, select option (C) as the answer: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Explanation:

(1) Aparna's brother having only one nephew tells us that Ajay is her only son, but this depends on the assumption that Aparna has only one brother, which is not mentioned in statement 1.
(2) Statement 2 mentioning Ruhi as Ajay's sister implies that Ajay is not her only son, since she is mentioned separately.
(1) and (2) together don't clarify if Aparna has another child or not; thus, we cannot conclude for certain that Ajay is her only son.

<s>[INST]How many students are sitting in a row facing the board? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Kavya, who is fifth from the left end, is ninth to the left of Aadesh who is seventh from the right end.
2. Jagrav is eighth to the right of Neerja, who is sixteenth from the right end and fifth from the left end.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
1. From statement 1, we know that Kavya is 5th from the left end and Aadesh is 7th from the right end. Since Aadesh is to the right of Kavya, we can start counting from Kavya toward the right until we reach Aadesh. Then, we know that there are 9 students between them (5 gap spaces to the right of Kavya and 4 gap spaces to the left of Aadesh). If we add the 5 students to the left of Kavya and the 2 students to the right of Aadesh, we get a total of 16 students. However, we don't know if any of these students are sitting in the front or back rows facing away from the board, so statement 1 alone is insufficient.

2. For statement 2, we know that Neerja is 16th from the right end and 5th from the left end. This means that there are 15 students to the right of Neerja and 4 students to her left. If we add Neerja, we have a total of 20 students. Since Jagrav is eighth to the right of Neerja, there are 7 students to the right of Jagrav, meaning there are 13 students to the left of him. Adding Jagrav gives us a total of 24 students. Since Jagrav is not mentioned to be at either end, we can't assume that this lines up with the front or back rows, so statement 2 is insufficient alone.

When considering both statements together, we have a consistent result with statement 2 having 24 students. However, we still don't know if they are facing the board or not.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
Step 1: Analyze statement 1. It tells us how some colors are renamed in the game, but there is no information about the color of a fresh tomato. So, statement 1 alone is not sufficient.

Step 2: Analyze statement 2. It tells us how some colors are renamed in the game, and crucially for us, it states that red is called orange. A fresh tomato is typically red, so if red is called orange, then in the game a fresh tomato would be called orange. Statement 2 alone is sufficient.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: B


<s>[INST]Kubera, the wealthy king of the Yakshas, liked all things made of gold and silver. The king decided to gift every Yaksha family a spherical globe made of solid gold with a cylindrical silver rod passing through its center. His goldsmith told him that this would require a 6 cm long, perfectly cylindrical hole to be bored through each perfectly spherical golden globe in order to insert the silver piece. Only the gold surrounding the curved surface of the silver cylinder would be retained. Kubera wanted the silver rod to be inserted but he was worried that gold was going to have to be removed from each of the globes. The goldsmith assured him that there would still be a fair bit of gold still left after the drilling.
What was the remaining volume of the golden globe, after drilling, when it was ready to be inserted with the silver rod?
Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Each silver rod was perfectly aligned perfectly with the vertical axis of the globe.
2. The diameter of the silver rod was exactly 1.25 cm.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (F) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(F). The question can be answered without either statement.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: F
To determine the remaining volume of the golden globe after drilling, we need to know the diameter of the silver rod (since it will determine the diameter of the hole drilled through the globe). With this information, we can calculate the radius of the cylindrical hole and determine the volume of gold that remains.

Statement 2 provides us with the diameter of the silver rod, which is enough information to find the remaining volume of the golden globe. Statement 1, telling us how the silver rod is aligned, is not necessary for determining the remaining volume.

So the correct answer is:
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: B

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient. 

Statement 1 is not sufficient because it only talks about the last 54 pages and the time it was read which is after Friday's lunch, so it does not provide any information about the reading done on Thursday.

Statement 2 is not sufficient because it tells us that three-fifths of the book was read by Wednesday, but it does not provide any information about the reading done specifically on Thursday.

Together, the two statements are still not sufficient. Statement 1 does not mention Thursday, and statement 2 only gives information up to Wednesday, so neither statement provides any information about the reading done on Thursday.
Given answer: E

1. Karan said that he had one sister.
2. Jhanvi said that she had one brother.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Statement 1 tells us that Karan has one sister. This implies that Karan is a male and he has only one sibling, who is a sister to him. Since Jhanvi is mentioned separately, it can be inferred with certainty that Karan's sister is Jhanvi. Hence, statement 1 is sufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2, on the other hand, only tells us that Jhanvi has one brother. It does not specify who this brother is, so we cannot definitively say that this brother is Karan. It is possible that Jhanvi's brother is Karan, but it is also possible that Jhanvi's brother is someone else. Therefore, statement 2 alone is insufficient to answer the question.

Since statement 1 is sufficient to answer the question, we do not need to consider statement 2. Therefore, the correct answer is (A).
Given answer: A

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
1. Each girl has twice as many sisters as brothers.
2. The youngest child is a boy and he has 3 sisters.

From statement 2, we know that there are 3 girls in the family since the youngest child is a boy. Statement 2 is sufficient to answer the question and statement 1 is not needed to determine the answer.

Therefore, the correct option is (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: B


<s>[INST]At the finals of the All India Logic competition, the announcer displays six words:  MOSS, DRAG, CULT, CHOP, TRIM, GUTS. Each of the 4 finalists, representing the 4 regional champions within India (North, South, East & West), is given an envelope. Each of those 4 envelopes bear one distinct letter from one of those six words. All those distinct letters in the three envelopes are chosen from the same word. The contestants are forbidden from disclosing the letter in their envelope to anybody else. Each contestant has to determine the chosen word from the list of six.
The announcer asks the Eastern contestant, Durga, whether she can deduce the word. She instantly replies, “Yes!” Without asking her to identify the word, the announcer now moves to the regional champion from the North, Lakshmi and asks her whether she can identify the word. She thinks for a few seconds and then breaks into a smile, “Yes, I know the word.”
What is the word?
Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1.After Lakshmi, the announcer now looks at the contestant from the West and asks, “Saraswati , what about you?” Within moments, she too breaks into a smile and nods, “I know the word!”
2. The last person to answer is Meenakshi. She says, “Now I also know the word.”

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
The correct answer is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Here's the reasoning:

From statement 1 alone, we cannot determine the exact word. This is because if Saraswati from the West also knows the word, it could be any of the words that can be formed using the letters in the envelopes of Durga and Lakshmi, as well as her own envelope.

From statement 2 alone, we cannot determine the exact word either. This is because Meenakshi knowing the word only confirms that she has a letter from one of the words that Durga and Lakshmi have, but again, we do not know which word.

However, when we combine both statements, we can deduce the word. If Durga (East) knows the word, then each of the other regional champions must have a letter from the same word as Durga. Since Lakshmi (North) and Saraswati (West) both get the word, it means that each of them has a letter that is part of the word Durga has. Since Durga does not share her letter and all the regions have different letters, this narrows down the word possibilities based on the remaining word choices and the letters in the envelopes of Lakshmi and Saraswati. Then, when Meenakshi (South) also gets the word, it confirms that her envelope has the last remaining letter required for the word identified by the first three champions.

Thus, only when we combine both statements do we have sufficient information to identify the word. The word that matches both the letters from Durga (East), Lakshmi (North), Saraswati (West), and Meenakshi (South) is 'TRIM.' The letters in their envelopes would be T, R, I, and M respectively, forming the word TRIM using the letters in all their envelopes. The other five words in the list could not form a unique word using the envelopes of the finalists.

Correct answer: F
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

The question asks which of the two statements, "Vighnesh likes computer programming" and "Vighnesh likes playing video games," is sufficient to determine if Vighnesh likes computer programming.

Statement 1 indicates that Vighnesh likes computer programming, so it is sufficient to answer the question. It does not matter if statement 2 is true or false, as the question only requires us to determine if statement 1 is sufficient on its own.

Statement 2, "Vighnesh likes mathematics," does not provide any information about whether or not he likes computer programming, so it is not sufficient to answer the question.

Therefore, either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient to determine that Vighnesh likes computer programming, making option (C) the correct answer.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Explanation:

Statement 1 tells us that A is not lighter than C, but it doesn't give us any information about how A compares to B directly.

Statement 2 tells us that D weighs the same as A and B is heavier than D. This means that B is heavier than A because it's heavier than something (D) that weighs the same as A.

Taken together, the two statements provide enough information to answer the question. Since B is heavier than D and D weighs the same as A, then B must be heavier than A, making the answer to "Is A heavier than B?" no.

2. 'apo qe lans' means 'green mango leaf' and 'ka lans' means 'green book'.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
Analyzing Statement 1: 'apo fu qe nane' means 'mango leaf is long' and 'nane ko' means 'long stick'.
From this statement, we can extract the word 'nane' which means 'leaf'. So, 'nane' could potentially mean 'leaf', but we don't have enough information about the specific term for 'leaf'. Thus, Statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Analyzing Statement 2: 'apo qe lans' means 'green mango leaf' and 'ka lans' means 'green book'.
From this statement, we can deduce that 'apo' means 'green mango' and 'lans' means 'leaf'. While Statement 2 does not directly give us the word for 'leaf', it provides a component of it. Using logical deduction, we can combine 'n' (missing from Statement 1) and 'ane' (from Statement 1) to mean 'leaf'. Hence, Statement 2 is sufficient.

The correct answer is option (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Correct answer: A
First, we need to figure out if either statement allows us to determine how long it takes to fill the tank. 

(1) In half an hour, seven-twelfths of the tank is filled. This gives us enough information to calculate the time required to fill the tank, as long as we know the total capacity of the tank. So, statement 1 is sufficient.

(2) The pump is switched on at 9:00 a.m. This statement doesn't give us any information about the rate at which the pump fills the tank, so it's insufficient to determine how long it takes to fill the tank.

Therefore, we can conclude that Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient, so the correct answer is option (A).
Given answer: A


<s>[INST]How long was the CEO's speech? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. The CEO spoke 30 words per minute.
2. Had the CEO spoken 5 fewer words per minute her speech would have lasted 4 more minutes.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
To determine the length of the CEO's speech, we need to know the total number of words spoken and the speaking rate. Statement 1 provides us with the speaking rate (30 words per minute), but it doesn't give us the total number of words spoken. Statement 2, on the other hand, can be used to find the total number of words if we know the duration of the speech. However, Statement 2 does not provide enough information about the duration of the speech by itself.

Since Statement 1 doesn't offer enough information to determine the length of the speech, we must rely on Statement 2. However, Statement 2 cannot give us the answer without knowing the duration of the speech. Therefore, neither statement can answer the question independently.

Now, if we combine both statements, we have enough information to solve the problem:

1. From Statement 1, we know the speaking rate, 30 words per minute.
2. From Statement 2, we know that if the CEO had spoken 5 fewer words per minute, the speech would have been 4 minutes longer (which isn't specified, but for solving the purposes, we don't need the actual duration). This gives us an additional piece of information about the total number of words being a certain value higher than what it would be if the speaking rate were 5 words per minute lower (25 words per minute).
3. Using the relationship between words per minute and the total number of words, we can calculate the exact number of words in the speech and then determine the length based on the 30 words per minute rate.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
Given answer: D


<s>[INST]How many daughters does Devi have? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. X's father has 3 children.
2. Y is X's sister and daughter of Devi.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
From statement 1, we cannot determine how many of X's siblings are female, so it's not sufficient to answer the question.

From statement 2, we know that Y is X's sister and Devi's daughter. This tells us that Devi has at least one daughter, but we don't know if Devi has any other children.

Taking statements 1 and 2 together still does not give us enough information to definitively answer the question because statement 1 does not specify the genders of X's siblings.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
Given answer: E


<s>[INST]Among 5 friends - Anjali, Arun, Ritika, Vishwesh and Kartik, who is the tallest? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Anjali is taller than Arun and Kartik.
2. Arun is shorter than Ritika but taller than Vishwesh.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
1. From statement 1, we know that Anjali is taller than both Arun and Kartik, but we still don't have enough information about her height relative to Ritika and Vishwesh.
2. From statement 2, we know that Arun is taller than Vishwesh, and Ritika is taller than Arun. This gives us information about Ritika's height being more than Arun and Vishwesh but not about her height relative to Anjali and Kartik.
3. Taking both statements together, we can deduce that Anjali is taller than Arun and Kartik (statement 1), and Ritika is taller than Arun and Vishwesh (statement 2). We still don't have enough information to determine who the tallest person is because we don't have any comparison between Anjali and Ritika or Kartik and Vishwesh.

Therefore, the correct option is (E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
Given answer: E


<s>[INST]How is X related to Y? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. X's father is married to Z.
2. Y is the daughter of Z, who has a son and daughter.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
1. X's father is married to Z.
2. Y is the daughter of Z, who has a son and daughter.

From statement 1, we cannot determine the relationship between X and Y directly. However, from statement 2, we know that Y is Z's child, and since Z is married to X's father, this implies that Y is either X's sister (if Z is married to X's father and had children from a previous relationship) or X's stepsister (if Z is X's father's second wife).

Let's analyze the options:

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient. This is incorrect because statement 1 alone does not provide enough information to determine the relationship between X and Y.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient. This is correct since statement 2 alone provides enough information to infer that X and Y are either siblings or stepsiblings.

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient. This is incorrect because statement 1 alone is not sufficient.

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient. This is incorrect because statement 2 alone is sufficient.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient. This is incorrect because statement 2 alone is sufficient.

So, the correct answer is (B): Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

<s>[INST]Each of A, B, C and D play exactly one sport among football, cricket, hockey and chess. Who plays cricket? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. A plays hockey.
2. C plays neither chess nor football.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Explanation:

From statement 1, we know that A plays hockey. This means that A cannot play cricket, chess, or football, so the only remaining option for B, C, and D is cricket. Statement 1 is sufficient to determine that B, C, or D plays cricket.

Statement 2 only tells us that C does not play chess or football, but it does not give us any information about the possibility of C playing cricket or hockey. This statement is insufficient to determine who plays cricket.

Since statement 1 is sufficient and statement 2 is not, the answer is (A).
Given answer: A


<s>[INST]How much does a clock lose in a day? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. The clock shows 7:45 a.m.
2. The hour and minute hands coincide every 63 minutes starting at noon.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient. 

Here's why:

Statement 1: The clock simply shows a time, it doesn't provide any information about the clock's rate of loss. Therefore, it's insufficient.

Statement 2: This statement tells us that the clock's hands overlap every 63 minutes, not 60 as in a standard clock, which means the clock loses around 3 minutes every hour. However, it doesn't tell us the actual time, so it's also insufficient.

Combining both statements: Knowing the time (statement 1) doesn't help us determine how much the clock loses per day, and while statement 2 tells us the clock loses 3 minutes every hour, it doesn't leave us with enough information to determine the cumulative loss over a full day. Therefore, neither statement nor both together are sufficient.

In summary, the regular clock loses approximately 18 minutes (3 minutes * 60/13 hours) each day, but neither statement provides sufficient information to determine this, making (E) the correct answer.
Given answer: E


<s>[INST]How many tabla instructors teach in this city? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. There is one tabla instructor for each of the 52 classes held in this city
2. Each tabla instructor teaches 5 students.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
Step 1: Analyze statement 1.
statement 1: There is one tabla instructor for each of the 52 classes held in this city

This statement gives us information about the number of tabla instructors based on the number of classes, but we don't know if each class has only one student or multiple students. So statement 1 alone is not sufficient.

Step 2: Analyze statement 2.
statement 2: Each tabla instructor teaches 5 students.

This statement gives us information about the number of students per instructor, but it doesn't give us any details about the total number of instructors or classes. So statement 2 alone is not sufficient.

Step 3: Analyze statement 1 and 2 together.

With both statements, we can determine the number of tabla instructors. We know that there are 52 classes (from statement 1) and each instructor teaches 5 students (from statement 2). By dividing the total number of classes by the number of students per instructor, we can find out how many instructors there are.

So, 52 classes / 5 students per instructor = 10.4. Since we cannot have a fraction of an instructor, we round up to the nearest whole number to account for all classes. Therefore, there are 11 tabla instructors in this city.

The correct answer is (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
Given answer: D


<s>[INST]There are two hospitals. One of them is near me while the other is far away. In which of the hospitals will there be more male births than female births? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. 50.9% of all babies born in a given year are male while 49.1% are female.
2. The nearby hospital has a small maternity ward while the one far away has a much larger maternity ward.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Explanation:

Neither of the given statements indicates any gender bias in either of the hospitals. Statement 1 gives the usual ratio of male to female births, but this is consistent across all populations. Statement 2 addresses the size of the maternity wards, but this has no bearing on the gender ratio of newborns. Therefore, neither statement is sufficient alone or taken together.
Given answer: E


<s>[INST]Is A B's brother? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. C is B's spouse.
2. A is C's relative.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Explanation:

From statement 1, we know that C is B's spouse, but it doesn't give us any information about the relationship between A and B.
From statement 2, we know that A is C's relative, which means A could be B's relative through marriage or by blood relation with C, but we don't have enough information to determine if A is specifically B's brother.

However, if we combine both statements, then we can conclude that A must be B's brother:
- Statement 1 tells us that C is B's spouse, so C is not biologically related to B.
- Statement 2 tells us that A is C's relative, so A and C share a biological connection.
- Since C is married to B and not biologically related, the only way for A to be related to C is through C's family.
- Therefore, the most likely explanation is that A is B's brother.

Since none of the statements alone are enough to determine that A is B's brother, but combining them leads to that conclusion, the correct answer is:

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
Given answer: A


<s>[INST]How many fans went to the stadium yesterday? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. In total, 2343 single-person tickets were bought.
2. The stadium can seat 2600 fans.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
Let's evaluate the statements:

Statement 1: In total, 2343 single-person tickets were bought.
This gives us a certain number of individual fans that came to the stadium, but it doesn't account for the possibility of some fans having multi-person tickets or there being seats that weren't sold. So by itself, Statement 1 is not sufficient.

Statement 2: The stadium can seat 2600 fans.
This gives us a maximum capacity for the stadium, but it doesn't tell us how many fans actually showed up. There could be any number of unoccupied seats. So by itself, Statement 2 is not sufficient.

However, when we consider both statements together, we know that even if every seat was sold and occupied, the maximum number of fans would be 2600. Since only 2343 tickets were sold (from Statement 1), it means that no more than 2343 fans attended the game, regardless of the stadium's capacity. Therefore, we can definitively answer the question with both statements, but not with either statement alone.

The correct answer is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
Given answer: D


<s>[INST]There are 4 friends - M, N, O and P. How many friends are older than O? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. M is not younger than P and O is older than N.
2. P is older than exactly two friends.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
Let's examine each statement individually:

1. M is not younger than P and O is older than N.
From this statement, we know that O is older than at least one person (N). However, we have no information about P's age relative to O. So, statement 1 alone is insufficient.

2. P is older than exactly two friends.
This means that P is older than both M and N, but we don't know anything about the relationship between O and P. If O is older than both M and N, then there would be no friend who is older than O. But if one or both of M and N are older than O, then they would be two of the three friends who are older than O. Since we cannot definitively answer the question based on statement 2 alone, it too is insufficient.

However, when we take both statements together, we can deduce that P is older than exactly two friends, one of whom is N, and O is older than N. Therefore, since P is older than two people and one of them is not O, only one person other than P is older than O (which is M). Hence, statements 1 and 2 together are sufficient.

So, the correct answer is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Explanation:
From statement 1, we know that there are a total of 56 students in the class. If Ravi is ranked 22nd from the top, then his rank from the bottom is simply the total number of students minus his rank from the top:

Rank from the bottom = Total students - Rank from the top
Rank from the bottom = 56 - 22 = 34

Therefore, if we only know statement 1, we can determine Ravi's rank from the bottom. However, we cannot determine his rank from the bottom using statement 2 alone, as we do not have enough information about the total number of students in the class.

Note: If you were given statement 2 and additional information specifying the total number of students, then it would be possible to determine Ravi's rank from the bottom using statement 2. However, since no such information is provided in statement 2, we can only use the information given in each statement independently to determine our answer.

1. Neither S nor T pairs with either Q or R.
2. Neither P nor Q pairs with either S or U.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
1. Neither S nor T pairs with either Q or R.
This statement tells us that S and T pair with each other or with P and U. However, we cannot determine which pairs are P, Q, R, S, T, U based on this information alone. Insufficient.

2. Neither P nor Q pairs with either S or U.
This statement rules out the possibility that P pairs with S or U and Q pairs with S or U. So, P must pair with R and Q must pair with either S or T. This leaves T paired with U, as S cannot pair with R (since P pairs wih neither Q nor R). Then, based on this information, we can determine the pairs: P-R, Q-S, T-U. Sufficient.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
