[/INST]


Correct answer: B

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

If Cole is under 7 feet tall, it doesn't necessarily mean he is over 6 feet tall, as he could be anywhere from 0 inches to 6 feet 11 inches. So, statement 1 alone is insufficient.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

If every player on Cole's varsity basketball team is above 6'1", this means that Cole is also above 6'1", making statement 2 sufficient to answer the question.

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

We've already established that statement 1 alone is insufficient, so this option cannot be correct.

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Since we've determined that statement 1 alone is insufficient and statement 2 alone is sufficient, statement 1 does not add any new information in combination with statement 2. Therefore, statements 1 and 2 taken together are not sufficient.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

However, we've determined that statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Conclusion:
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

1. Elephants are Alice's favourite animals. 
2. Zebras are the animals that Alice likes the least.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
1. Statement 1: "Elephants are Alice's favorite animals."

If this statement is true, then we know that Alice likes elephants very much, but we don't have any information about how she feels about zebras. Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient to determine if Alice likes elephants more than zebras.

2. Statement 2: "Zebras are the animals that Alice likes the least."

Similarly, if this statement is true, we know that Alice doesn't like zebras as much as other animals, but we don't have any information about her feelings towards elephants. Statement 2 alone is also insufficient to determine if Alice likes elephants more than zebras.

Now let's consider both statements together:

Together, these statements indicate that Alice's favorite animal is the elephant and that she likes zebras the least among all animals. From these two pieces of information, we can conclude that yes, Alice does like elephants more than zebras.

However, neither statement alone was sufficient, so we needed both pieces of information together to arrive at our answer.

Conclusion:
(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

While both statements alone are insufficient, both combined give us the necessary information to determine that Alice does indeed prefer elephants over zebras.

<s>[INST]All the students in a classroom wrote an exam. How many students are in the classroom? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Five students failed. 
2. One student was 29th from the top and 16th from the bottom.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
Statement 1: Five students failed.
This piece of information tells us something about the number of students who did not perform well, but it doesn't give us any specifics about the total number of students in the class. Even if we knew the maximum possible number of students who could fail (which would be the total number of students), we are still missing the crucial information about the actual total number of students. Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Statement 2: One student was 29th from the top and 16th from the bottom.
This statement tells us that there are at least 29 + 16 - 1 = 44 students in the class because a student can't be both 29th from the top and 16th from the bottom in a smaller class size. However, it doesn't necessarily mean that this is the exact total number of students since there could be more students above the 29th position. But this statement gives us a minimum count, making it more helpful than statement 1. However, because it doesn't provide an exact count, we cannot conclude the total number solely based on this statement.

Now, let's consider both statements together:
Since statement 2 tells us that there are at least 44 students, and no matter how many additional students there are beyond the 29th place, they will not change the fact that five students were still at the bottom (since being at the bottom is not dependent on the total number of students). Therefore, the fact that five students failed (statement 1) does not add any new relevant information when considered alongside statement 2.

Thus, the correct answer is:
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

1. Samuel is not facing North. 
2. Samuel is facing the sun.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E

Statement 1: Samuel is not facing North.
This statement alone is not sufficient because it doesn't give us enough information to determine which direction Samuel is facing. He could be facing in any other direction - South, East, or West.

Statement 2: Samuel is facing the sun.
This statement alone could be sufficient if we know where the sun is located. If we are told that the sun is in the East, for example, then we know that Samuel must be facing East. However, it's important to note that the sun's position changes depending on the time of day, so this statement would only be sufficient if we have more context about the time of day.

Now let's consider both statements together:

- If Samuel is not facing North, then he could be facing South, East, or West.
- If Samuel is facing the sun, then depending on the time of day, this could help us determine which direction he is facing. For example, if we know that it's dawn, then the sun would be in the East, so Samuel must be facing East.

However, the problem with using both statements together is that they don't necessarily point to one unique direction. For example, if it's dawn and Samuel is not facing North, this doesn't necessarily mean he is facing East - he could also be facing South or West, depending on his exact position and the curvature of the Earth.

Therefore, neither statement alone is sufficient, and despite providing some helpful information, the two statements taken together do not provide enough information to definitively answer the question.

The correct answer is option (E): Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
Let's evaluate the sufficiency of each statement:

1. "There are no red balls in the basket." This statement does not provide any information about the presence or absence of blue or green balls. Therefore, it is insufficient to conclude that there are only blue balls in the basket.

2. "The smallest ball in the basket is green." This statement tells us that there is at least one green ball and that it is the smallest. However, this does not preclude the possibility of having blue balls as well or other colors. Thus, statement 2 alone is insufficient.

So far, neither statement can individually confirm that all the balls are blue. 

Now let's consider them together:

Combining both statements still does not give us enough information to conclude that all the balls are blue. We know there are no red balls and that the smallest ball is green, but other colors could still be present.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

<s>[INST]Does Leonid like carrots? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Leonid hates vegetables.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
Step 1: Analyze Statement 1 - "Leonid hates vegetables."
If this statement is true, then it is likely that Leonid does not like carrots since they are classified as a vegetable. However, we cannot be 100% certain without more information about Leonid's preferences regarding specific vegetables like carrots.

Step 2: Analyze Statement 2 - "Leonid prefers carrots to leeks."
If this statement is true, then we know that Leonid has at least some level of affinity for carrots over leeks, but this does not necessarily mean that he likes carrots in general.

Step 3: Evaluate each option:

(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
We cannot definitively say that Statement 1 alone is sufficient because Statement 2 provides additional information about Leonid's preference for carrots over leeks, which could potentially contradict Statement 1.

(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
Statement 2 alone is not sufficient because it only tells us about Leonid's preference between carrots and leeks, not whether he actually likes carrots or not.

(C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
This cannot be true, as neither statement alone provides enough information to definitively answer the question.

(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
Taking both statements together, we would have evidence that Leonid may not like vegetables in general (Statement 1), but also that he prefers carrots to leeks (Statement 2). This still does not conclusively prove that Leonid likes carrots, so even with both statements, we cannot answer the question definitively.

(E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
Since options (A), (B), and (D) have been deemed incorrect, only option (E) remains, which means that neither statement nor both statements taken together provide enough information to conclude whether Leonid likes carrots or not.

Correct Option: (E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
1. Probability of event A is 0.55.
This statement is not sufficient to find the probability of event B because we don't have any information about how events A and B are related. 

2. Probability of either A or B or both A and B happening is 0.65.
This statement tells us about the probability of A union B (i.e., P(A or B)). We know that P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). So if we know this, and we know P(A), then we can solve for P(B). Therefore, statement 2 alone is sufficient.

However, using both statements together does give us more information than just using statement 2 alone. If we knew that P(A) was greater than P(A or B), then we would know that the events must overlap (i.e., there must be some chance that they both occur). However, since we are not given any such information, we can't determine this from statement 1.

So, the correct answer is:
(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

The logic for statement 1 being sufficient is that it gives a clear criterion for needing a special license: buildings with more than 20 floors require one. Since the question doesn't specify the number of floors the contractor wants to build, this statement alone could potentially answer the question.

However, statement 1 is actually not enough to determine the answer on its own. We don't know whether the contractor intends to build a building with more than 20 floors. If they did, this statement would indeed be sufficient, but because the number of floors the contractor wants to build is not stated, we cannot definitively say whether or not they need a special license based solely on this information.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

This statement cannot be sufficient on its own, as it does not provide any information about whether certain types of buildings require a special license. We only know that a building contractor wants to build a 30-storey building.

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because neither statement provides enough information on its own to definitively answer the question.

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Combining both statements, we know that the contractor wants to build a 30-storey building and that buildings with more than 20 floors require a special license. However, the information about the contractor's plans does not necessarily imply that they're planning to build a taller-than-20-floor building, so we cannot determine if they need a special license.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

We have determined that neither statement alone is sufficient, and when taken together, they still do not provide enough information to conclusively determine if the contractor needs a special license.

The correct answer is therefore (E).

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
1. Statement 1: If 5 brick-laying machines work with 5 men the wall will be built in 7.5 hours.

First, we need to understand the rate at which the men and machines are working. 

From the question, we know that 10 men can build a wall in 6 hours. Therefore, the rate of work done by 10 men is:

Rate = Work / Time 
= 1 wall / 6 hours
= (1/6) wall/hour (when 10 men work)

According to statement 1, 5 machines along with 5 men can build the same wall in 7.5 hours. So, the rate of work done by 5 machines and 5 men is:

Rate = Work / Time 
= 1 wall / 7.5 hours
= (4/15) wall/hour (when 5 men and 5 machines work)

Since the rate of work done by 5 machines and 5 men is (4/15) wall/hour, the rate of work done by 5 machines alone is:

Rate of 5 machines = Rate of 5 machines and 5 men - Rate of 5 men
= (4/15) wall/hour - (1/12) wall/hour (since 10 men do twice the work in the same time as 5 men)
= (1/3) wall/hour

Using this rate, we can calculate the time it takes for 5 machines to build the wall:

Time = Work / Rate
= 1 wall / (1/3) wall/hour
= 3 hours

Hence, statement 1 alone is sufficient. 

2. Statement 2: The brick-laying machines work twice as fast as the men.

Since 10 men build the wall in 6 hours, the rate of work done by 10 men is:

Rate = Work / Time 
= 1 wall / 6 hours
= (1/6) wall/hour (when 10 men work)

If the brick-laying machines work twice as fast as the men, then the rate of work done by 1 machine is:

Rate of 1 machine = 2 * Rate of 1 man
= 2 * (1/12) wall/hour (since 10 men do twice the work in the same time as 5 men)
= (1/6) wall/hour

Using this rate, we can calculate the time it takes for 5 machines to build the wall:

Time = Work / Rate
= 1 wall / (5/6) wall/hour
= 1.2 hours

However, this contradicts the calculation derived from statement 1, making statement 2 insufficient.

Since statement 1 is sufficient and statement 2 is not only insufficient but also contradicts statement 1, the correct option is:

(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: A


<s>[INST]What is the number of people in Ramya's restaurant? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?

2. The sum of the number of people in Ramya's restaurant and Abhinav's restaurant is equal to 70.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E

Step 1: Evaluate statement 1.
Statement 1 tells us that the number of people in Abhinav's restaurant is at least 10 less than the number of people in Ramya's restaurant. However, this statement does not give us an exact number for the number of people in Ramya's restaurant, only a relative difference compared to Abhinav's restaurant. So, we cannot determine the exact number based on statement 1 alone.

Step 2: Evaluate statement 2.
Statement 2 tells us that the sum of the number of people in Ramya's and Abhinav's restaurants is equal to 70. This gives us a total number for both restaurants but does not provide individual counts for each restaurant. Therefore, statement 2 alone is insufficient to determine the number of people in Ramya's restaurant.

Step 3: Evaluate both statements together.
Using both statements, we know that the number of people in Abhinav's restaurant is at least 10 less than the number of people in Ramya's restaurant and the combined total of people in both restaurants is 70. From this information, we can calculate the maximum possible number of people in Ramya's restaurant (70 minus the minimum possible number of people in Abhinav's restaurant, which is 10 less than the number in Ramya's restaurant). This would be (70 - (Ramya's restaurant - 10)) = Ramya's restaurant. Solving this equation gives us Ramya's restaurant = 40.

However, the question asks for the number of people in Ramya's restaurant, not just whether the statements are sufficient or not. Since we were able to calculate a specific number using both statements, we can conclude:

Answer: (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
1. Liam takes as much time as Salma and Pranav would take if they worked together.

This statement alone is not sufficient to determine which person finished the task in the least amount of time. We know that Liam's time is equal to the combined time of Salma and Pranav, but we do not have any information about their individual times or their relative efficiency. Hence, we cannot conclude who finished the task in the least amount of time based on this statement alone.

2. Salma takes double the amount of time that Pranav and Liam take working together.

This statement alone is not sufficient to determine which person finished the task in the least amount of time. The phrase "double the amount of time" is ambiguous; it could refer to either Salma's time being twice as long as Pranav and Liam's combined time, or Salma taking twice as long as both Pranav and Liam working individually. Without knowing the specific meaning of "double the amount of time," we cannot pinpoint who finished the task in the least amount of time.

Considering both statements together:

Together, these statements give us more information to work with. Salma takes double the amount of time Liam and Pranav take working together, and Liam takes as much time as Salma and Pranav would take if they worked together. If Salma takes twice as long as Liam and Pranav combined, then Liam and Pranav would take half the time Salma does when working together. Since Liam's time is equal to Salma and Pranav working together, it is evident that Liam is the fastest worker among the three.

Therefore, we can conclude that Liam finished the task in the least amount of time based on both statements, which is option (D) - Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
1. Statement 1: "There are fewer girls than boys."

For: This statement tells us that there are more boys than girls among the children, but it doesn't specify how many of each gender there are. So, this statement alone is not sufficient to determine the exact number of boys.

Against: Since we know that there are only seven children in total, if there were fewer girls, then that would mean there are more boys. With this information, along with knowing the total number of children, we can deduce the exact number of boys. However, the statement does not provide enough detail to do so.

2. Statement 2: "Each girl has half as many sisters as brothers."

For: If each girl has half as many sisters as brothers, this means that the number of girls must be evenly divisible by 2, with the result being one less than the number of boys. This is because for each girl, there is one less girl than there are boys. For example, if a girl has one sister, she has two brothers. If a girl has two sisters, she has three brothers, and so forth. However, Statement 2 does not give enough information to deduce the exact number of boys or girls.

Against: While Statement 2 does not give enough information to determine the exact number of boys or girls, it does show a mathematical relationship between the number of girls and the number of boys. We can deduce that there must be an odd number of girls and an even number of boys, but we do not have enough information to ascertain the exact numbers.

Since neither statement alone provides enough information to answer the question, (A) and (B) are incorrect. We are left with (C), (D), or (E). We cannot use (C) because we cannot determine the exact number of boys based on either statement alone. While combining the statements does provide some insight, such as the fact that there must be an odd number of girls and an even number of boys, it does not provide enough information to arrive at an exact number for either gender. Therefore, we cannot select (D) either.

Thus, the correct answer is (E): Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient. This is because neither statement alone gives enough information to determine the exact number of boys, and although the statements together suggest an odd number of girls and even number of boys, they still do not provide enough information to determine exact numbers for either gender.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
Let's analyze each statement:

1. "Either Alexia or Jenny is a doctor."
This statement only tells us that one of them holds the title of doctor, but it doesn't specify who. It could be Alexia, or it could be Jenny. So this statement alone is not sufficient to answer the question.

2. "Alexia and Jenny are a doctor and nurse respectively."
This statement clearly indicates that Alexia is the doctor and Jenny is the nurse. Therefore, statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

With the above analysis, we can conclude:
(A) Statement 1 alone is insufficient while statement 2 alone is sufficient,
which matches option (B). Therefore, the correct answer is option (B).

Final answer: Statement 2 alone is sufficient.

<s>[INST]Will there be more crocodile attacks next year? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. There were more crocodile attacks this year than last year. 
2. 56 people were attacked by crocodiles this year.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E

Step 1: Evaluate statement 1. "There were more crocodile attacks this year than last year." This statement does not provide enough information to determine if there will be more crocodile attacks next year. We do not know the reason why there were more attacks this year, so we cannot predict future trends. Thus, statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Step 2: Evaluate statement 2. "56 people were attacked by crocodiles this year." This statement also does not provide enough information to determine if there will be more crocodile attacks next year. We only know the number of attacks this year, but we have no information about previous years or future projections. Thus, statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Step 3: Evaluate both statements together. Since each statement alone is insufficient, let's consider them together. Still, there is no information about previous years or future projections; we only know the number of attacks this year. This lack of context makes it impossible to determine if there will be more crocodile attacks next year. 

Step 4: Conclusion. Neither statement provides enough information on its own, and even when considered together, the information is still insufficient. Therefore, the correct answer is (E): Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

2. In 1998, the African regional group received the largest fraction of UN aid.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
This is incorrect because the nationality of the Secretary General does not determine the size of the regional group from Africa.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
This is plausible as the fraction of UN aid received by a region could be indicative of its size in the UN. However, this doesn't directly answer the question, it only provides indirect evidence.

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
This is incorrect because neither statement fully answers the question.

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
This could be correct as they both provide pieces of information that could be used to infer the answer.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
This is incorrect, as statements 1 and 2 together do provide enough information to infer the answer.

The correct answer is (D). statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Although Statement 2 alone provides indirect evidence, when taken together with Statement 1, which does not directly address the question but provides context about the UN leadership structure, we can infer that African states were likely the largest regional group in 1999.

Correct answer: A
Step 1: Evaluate the value of x from each statement.

Statement 1: x = 3
This statement directly gives us the value of x. So, this statement is sufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2: x = x
This statement is an identity, which is true for any value of x. It doesn't give any specific value for x. So, this statement is not sufficient to answer the question.

Step 2: Compare your answers with the given options.

Option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient. (This is correct)

Option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient. (This is incorrect because statement 2 doesn't provide any specific value of x)

Option C: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient. (This is incorrect because only statement 1 provides a specific value)

Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient. (This is incorrect because statement 2 doesn't add any new information)

Option E: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient. (This is incorrect because statement 1 alone is sufficient)

So, the correct answer is Option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
To answer the question, "Does our city have enough beds for patients?" we need to compare the number of beds in our city with the minimum number of beds required for the city's population.

Statement 1: A city needs at least 100 beds per thousand people.
This statement gives us a general rule but doesn't directly tell us about our city, so it's not sufficient. We would need to know the population of our city to determine if 100 beds per thousand people is enough.

Statement 2: Our city has 150 beds per thousand people.
This statement directly gives us the necessary information about our city's healthcare capacity. So, this statement alone is sufficient.

There's no need to consider both statements together because statement 2 is sufficient on its own.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
First, let's consider statement 1: "Student X got 7 questions correct." 

The total number of questions in the test is not specified. If the test has 10 questions, then getting 7 correct would mean that Student X has achieved a score of 70%, thus passing the test. However, if the test has more than 10 questions, then scoring 70% would require more than 7 correct answers. Therefore, statement 1 alone is not sufficient (A is correct).

Now let's consider statement 2: "Student X got all the questions correct."

This statement implies that Student X scored 100% on the test. No matter how many questions there are on the test, achieving 100% guarantees that Student X has scored higher than the 70% pass mark. Therefore, statement 2 alone is sufficient (B is incorrect).

Since we've found that statement 2 is sufficient on its own, we don't need to consider whether taking both statements together would provide additional information. However, for completeness:

If we take both statements together, we know that Student X got 7 questions correct and that Student X got all the questions correct. These two statements are contradictory unless there were indeed 7 questions on the test. Based on this, even though it's redundant, taking both statements together they are still sufficient (D is incorrect).

Therefore, the correct answer is (B): Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
Let's analyze each statement:

1. The area of circle B is two times the area of circle A.

If the area of circle B is twice the area of circle A, it means that circle B has more space inside it than circle A. However, this does not necessarily mean that circle B's boundary (its circumference) is larger than circle A's. It is possible for a larger circle to have an area twice as large as a smaller one if the smaller circle has been "squished" down into a smaller surface area but retains its proportional height.

Think of two circles made out of clay where you're comparing their surface areas (2D view), not their volumes (3D view). You could squish one circle into a flatter, wider shape with the same circumference as the other, non-squished circle, but since you've spread out the clay, the non-squished circle will have a smaller area.

However, in the case of circles, this scenario is impossible because all circles are perfectly round. So while statement 1 alone isn't enough to conclusively prove that circle B's radius is larger, it does heavily imply it. 

2. The radius of circle B is less than the radius of circle A.

By definition, the radius of a circle is the distance from the center point to the edge of the circle. If the radius of circle B is less than the radius of circle A, then circle B must be smaller in both area and circumference.

Conclusion:
Statement 1 alone is insufficient because it only talks about area, not the radius or circumference. Statement 2 alone is sufficient because the radius of a circle determines both its area and circumference.

Answer: (B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

(F). The question can be answered without either statement.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: F

To answer this question, let's consider each statement individually and then together:

1. You are allowed to pour water out of the cup into a measuring cylinder or any other container. 

This statement alone is not sufficient because we don't know the exact amount of water in the cup, only that it appears more than half full to Neha and at least half empty to Vighnesh. Pouring the water into another container won't help us determine if it's exactly half full unless we have a way to measure the volume.

2. You are allowed to use a ruler or measuring tape.

This statement alone is also not sufficient. A ruler or measuring tape would be used to measure length, not volume. Since volume is what's in question here, a device to measure length wouldn't provide any useful information.

However, if we consider both statements together, they become sufficient. We could pour the water into a container with marked measurements (option A) to determine the volume, or better yet, we could use the fact that one milliliter of liquid is roughly equal to one cubic centimeter (cc or cm^3) of space. If Neha and Vighnesh both agree on the height of the water in the cup, then a ruler (or even a pencil and some paper) could be used to measure the height of the water column, then calculate the volume based on the cross-sectional area of the cup at that height (option B).

Therefore, the correct answer choice is D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Correct answer: D
1. Statement 1: Bill's gardening budget is $300 and he has spent some of the budget. This statement is not sufficient to determine if Bill can afford to buy more $50 pots for his garden because we don't know how much of the budget has been spent or on what it was spent.

For: It does tell us that Bill has a budget of $300, which might be relevant.
Against: It does not provide enough information about how the budget has been used.

2. Statement 2: Bill has only spent his budget on 7 plants that cost $40 each. This statement is sufficient to determine that Bill can afford to buy more $50 pots for his garden. We know he has a budget of $300 which was only used for 7 plants costing $40 each, so he still has $220 left.

For: It tells us exactly how much of the budget was used and on what, enabling us to calculate the remaining budget.
Against: It doesn't explicitly mention the remaining budget, but the calculation is simple.

Since statement 2 is sufficient on its own to answer the question, the correct option is B. Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
1. Statement 1: "Justin's sister's father's son is Tim."

To understand this, let's break it down:
- Justin's sister's father is Justin's dad.
- So, the son of Justin's dad is Justin himself or his brother.
- Therefore, if Justin's sister's father's son is Tim, then either Tim is Justin's brother or Justin himself.

This statement provides enough information to conclude that Tim is related to Justin as either his brother or brother-in-law. Therefore, statement 1 alone is sufficient.

2. Statement 2: "Justin is Tim's brother's father-in-law's only daughter's brother-in-law."

Let's break this down:
- Tim's brother's father-in-law is Tim's brother-in-law's father.
- The only daughter of this person would be Tim's sister-in-law.
- So, Justin being the brother-in-law of this person indicates that he is Tim's brother.

This statement also provides enough information to conclude that Tim is related to Justin as his brother. Therefore, statement 2 alone is also sufficient.

So, both statements 1 and 2 are individually sufficient to answer the question.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on.

Statement 1: x is divisible by the factors of 10.
10 has factors 1, 2, 5, and 10. If x is divisible by any of these, then x is not a prime number (except if x=2), because primes have only two factors: 1 and the number itself. So, if x is divisible by 2 or 5 (which are contained in the factors of 10), then x cannot be a prime number (except if x=2).

However, if x is greater than 13 (statement 2), then x could still be a prime number, as long as it isn't divisible by any other number up to its square root (because any factor larger than the square root would have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root).

But statement 1 tells us that x is divisible by factors of 10, so we don't need to consider the higher factors from statement 2.

Therefore, statement 1 is sufficient to determine that x is not a prime number (except if x=2). Statement 2 is not required to make this determination.

So, the correct answer is:
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: A

Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
1. Half the people in the office don't read the newspaper.

This statement only gives us information about how many people do not read the newspaper, but it does not provide a concrete number or percentage of people who do read it. So by itself, this statement is insufficient to answer the question.

2. 10% of the people in Maria's office read the newspaper.

This statement clearly provides a specific number of people who read the newspaper. However, this number represents only 10% of the total people in the office, which doesn't give us enough information to determine whether this is enough to make up for the other half that statement 1 mentioned.

When considering each statement individually, neither of them provides complete information to definitively answer the question. Therefore, neither statement A nor statement B can be correct.

If we consider both statements together, we can determine the answer. Statement 1 tells us that half the people in the office don't read the newspaper, which means the other half must. If statement 2 is true and 10% of the people in the office read the newspaper, this 10% must be part of the half that reads the newspaper. Therefore, unless the total number of employees in Maria's office is less than 20, then both statements together are sufficient to conclude that there are more than 50% of people in Maria's office who read the newspaper (the 10% from statement 2 and at least another 40% from the remaining half).

The correct answer choice is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Correct answer: B
1. Komal is neither the tallest nor the shortest.

This statement alone is not sufficient because we don't have enough information about the heights of the other women relative to each other. It does narrow down the possibilities for Komal's height, but it doesn't tell us exactly where she stands in the ranking of their heights.

2. Rita is only taller than Kathy and Komal.

This statement alone is sufficient to determine who the third tallest person is, because it sets up a clear height hierarchy among three of the women: Rita > Kathy > Komal. Since no two people are of the same height, that means Rachel must be taller than Komal but not as tall as Rita, making her the third tallest. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (B): Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

[/INST]


Correct answer: A
1. Statement 1: x is an even number.
    If x is an even number, then it is divisible by 2. So, statement 1 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

2. Statement 2: The square root of x is greater than 4.
    If the square root of x is greater than 4, this means that x is greater than 16 (since square roots are positive). Any number greater than 16 and even would be divisible by 2, but an odd number greater than 16 would not be divisible by 2. Therefore, statement 2 alone is not sufficient to determine whether x is divisible by 2.

Let's consider the combinations of statements:
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is insufficient while statement 1 alone is sufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

From the above analysis, we can see that the correct answer is (A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
Step 1: Analyze Statement 1: "Five years ago, Qi's age was half of her current age."

If this statement is true, it means that Qi's age (let's call it x) follows this equation: x - 5 = 0.5x. 

By solving this equation, we find that x = 10. So, Qi's current age is 10 years.

Hence, Statement 1 is sufficient to answer the question.

Step 2: Analyze Statement 2: "Qi will be 23 years old in 5 years."

If this statement is true, it means that Qi's age in 5 years (let's call it y) follows this equation: y = 23.

However, this equation doesn't tell us anything about Qi's current age. It only tells us what her age will be in 5 years. Therefore, Statement 2 is insufficient to answer the question.

Step 3: Evaluate the options.

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient. (Correct)

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient. (Incorrect, because Statement 2 is insufficient.)

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E

1. Statement 1: Natasha correctly states that Tony's birthday is after 16th and before 19th March. This statement gives us a range for Tony's birthday, which can be either 17th or 18th March. So, by itself, Statement 1 is sufficient to answer the question. Answer option (A) could be correct.

2. Statement 2: Brenna incorrectly states that Tony's birthday is on 20th March. This statement contradicts the information provided in Statement 1, which gives us a range for Tony's birthday; therefore, Statement 2 is not necessary to answer the question. However, it does help confirm that Tony's birthday is not on 20th March.

Based on the information provided by both statements, we can conclude that Tony's birthday is on either 17th or 18th March. Statement 1 alone is sufficient to determine this, while Statement 2 only serves to confirm the incorrectness of one particular date, 20th March, which was not likely the intention of the question.

Therefore, the correct answer is option (A): Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

<s>[INST]There are 50 cowsheds on a farm. How many cows live on the farm? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Each cowshed contains one cow. 
2. There are at least 60 cows.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
1. Each cowshed contains one cow: This statement suggests that there is only one cow per cowshed. Therefore, if we multiply the number of cowsheds by one (the number of cows per cowshed), we will find out how many cows live on the farm. This statement is sufficient to answer the question.

2. There are at least 60 cows: This statement suggests that the number of cows is greater than or equal to 60. However, it does not give any information about the exact number of cows, so it is not sufficient to determine the exact number of cows based on the number of cowsheds.

Therefore, the correct option is (A): Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient. Notice that we do not need to consider the possibility that there are more cows than cowsheds, as the question asks for the minimum number of cows that can be inferred from the given statements.

Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Saina Nehwal has more physical stamina than P. V. Sindhu
2. P V Sindhu is ranked higher as a badminton player than Saina Nehwal.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (F) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(F). The question can be answered without either statement.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: F

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Logic for Statement 1: Physical stamina can impact the outcome of a best-of-three-games match because if Saina Nehwal loses the first game but has more physical stamina, she could potentially win the next two games. This is because longer matches may favor the player with greater endurance.

Contra for Statement 1: However, badminton relies on skill as much as stamina. Even with more stamina, Saina losing the first game might suggest that P.V. Sindhu is simply the better player in this particular match-up.

Logic for Statement 2: Being ranked higher generally means a player has better skills or consistent performance. If P.V. Sindhu is ranked higher than Saina Nehwal, one could assume that P.V. Sindhu would be more likely to win the match, even if Saina loses the first game.

Contra for Statement 2: Rankings do not account for current form, strategies used, or specific match-ups between players. A lower-ranked player (Saina Nehwal, in this case) could still defeat a higher-ranked player (P.V. Sindhu) in a particular match.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Logic for Statement 2: Explanation provided under option A above.

Contra for Statement 2: Explanation provided under option A above.

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Logic for Statement 1: Explanation provided under option A above.
Logic for Statement 2: Explanation provided under option A above.

Contra for Either Statement: We cannot determine whether each statement is equally strong or if they both provide unique value because we're considering their sufficiency individually, not collectively.

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Logic for Statement 1 and 2: While either statement alone does not provide enough information, together they can suggest an answer. If Saina Nehwal loses the first game, but she has more physical stamina, then she might use that stamina advantage to change tactics and win the next two games. However, P.V. Sindhu being a higher-ranked player might still be the preferred pick. Therefore, taken together, these statements do not definitively answer the question.

(F). The question can be answered without either statement.

This option is incorrect because depending on the outcome of the first game, we cannot answer the question without additional information about Saina Nehwal's stamina or P.V. Sindhu's ranking.

Conclusion:
Given the uncertainties discussed in each option, (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient seems the most appropriate answer. Although neither statement is individually sufficient, together they provide some insight into the scenario. Ultimately, though, we would still lack enough specific information to say with certainty whether Saina is more likely to lose the first game and win the match.

Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
To determine if some PQRs are also XYZs, let's analyze the given statements:

1. Some XYZs are ABCs.

This statement does not provide any information about the relationship between PQRs and XYZs, so it is insufficient to answer the question.

1. Some XYZs are PQRs.

This statement tells us that there is an overlap between XYZs and PQRs. Therefore, some PQRs are indeed XYZs by definition.

Looking at the options, we can conclude:

(A). Statement 1 alone is insufficient (explained above), and statement 2 alone is sufficient, making this the correct answer.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient, while statement 1 is not, which we've already established.

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient. Since we have determined that statement 2 alone is sufficient, this option is correct as well.

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient. While statement 2 alone is sufficient, taking both statements together still does not provide any additional information about the relationship between PQRs and XYZs (beyond what we know from statement 2), so this option is incorrect.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient. Since statement 2 alone is indeed sufficient, this option is incorrect.

Conclusion: The correct answer is (A), (B), or (C).

1. The author of "Under the Sun" only writes adventure books. 
2. Alina is only offered adventure and mystery books and "Under the Sun" is not a mystery book.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Explanation:

Statement 1: If the author of "Under the Sun" only writes adventure books, this implies that Alina, who wants to read an adventure book, would likely want to read "Under the Sun". This statement is sufficient on its own.

Statement 2: This statement tells us that Alina is offered both adventure and mystery books, and that "Under the Sun" is not a mystery book. However, we are not told whether or not "Under the Sun" is an adventure book, so we cannot determine if Alina would want to read it based on this information alone. Thus, statement 2 is insufficient.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Explanation:

Statement 1: As previously explained, statement 1 is insufficient because we are not certain about the genre of "Under the Sun".

Statement 2: Since Alina is being offered both adventure and mystery books, and "Under the Sun" is not a mystery book, it can be inferred that "Under the Sun" is an adventure book (because it's the only other genre mentioned). Therefore, Alina would want to read "Under the Sun". So, statement 2 alone is sufficient.

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Explanation:

Both explanations for (A) and (B) prove that either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient. Statement 1 provides the information directly, and statement 2 allows us to infer the information. Thus, this combined option is valid and the answer is (C) or either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Now, as we already have the correct answer, let's consider the last option:

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Explanation:

Since either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient, we don't actually need to consider both statements together, as we've already reached a conclusion based on each statement individually. However, considering them together still leads us to the same conclusion that Alina would want to read "Under the Sun". Since (C) is the correct answer, this option can be considered redundant for our purposes here.

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
1. Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Logic for: If Betty answered False, then the correct answer must be True. This information alone is sufficient to determine the correct answer to the True-or-False question that Betty answered incorrectly.

Logic against: Statement 1 does not provide any information about the total number of questions on the test or whether or not other students' answers were correct. Since we don't have enough information to determine if this is a consistent pattern across all questions or just an isolated incident, we cannot conclusively determine if statement 1 is sufficient on its own to answer the previous question without knowing anything about statement 2.

2. Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Logic for: If the test has 5 questions, we do not know which question Betty answered incorrectly nor do we know if her answer was False or True. However, it does imply that there could be other questions where her answer was correct and thus we cannot conclusively say that all of Betty's answers are incorrect.

Logic against: Statement 2 does not provide enough information to deduce what Betty's answer was, let alone whether it was correct or not. Therefore, we cannot solely rely on statement 2 to give us the correct answer.

3. Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

This statement contradicts the previous two statements, so neither logic for nor logic against applies here.

4. Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Logic for: When considered together, statements 1 and 2 tell us that Betty answered False on one question and that there are 5 questions in total. While this doesn't directly give us the correct answer, it does suggest that there's a possibility that Betty's other answers are correct, making it more likely that the correct answer to the question Betty got wrong is True rather than False.

Logic against: As mentioned above, while statements 1 and 2 together do suggest a higher likelihood of the correct answer being True, they still do not definitively give us the correct answer.

5. Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

This statement also contradicts the previous ones, so neither logic for nor logic against applies here.

Conclusion:
Out of all the given options, option (D) - Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient - comes closest to being correct because they do provide additional context when combined. However, even then, they do not directly give us the correct answer, only making it more likely. Therefore, none of the given options is correct.

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D

Let's analyze the given statements:

1. The difference in the marks obtained by T and U is eleven. U got the highest marks.

This statement only tells us about the difference between T and U, and that U has the highest marks. It does not provide any information about the relationship between S and V's marks. Hence, it is insufficient to find the difference in marks between S and V.

2. The difference in the marks obtained by S and T is fifteen and the difference in the marks obtained by U and V is nine.

Now this statement provides information about both pairs S-T and U-V. Since U has the highest marks, then the absolute maximum that V can have is U's marks minus the difference between U and V (which is nine). We also know that T has more marks than S, but since we don't know whether T's mark is higher than V's, we cannot definitively determine the difference between S and V's marks.

However, we can use this statement to find a range of possible differences in marks between S and V. To do this, first consider the extreme case where T has just enough extra marks to exceed U: T = U+11. In this case, since the difference between S and T is 15, and between U and V is 9, the difference between S and V is (15 - 9) = 6.

Conversely, consider the other extreme case where T has just enough extra marks to exceed V: T = V+11. Since U has the highest marks, in this scenario the difference between S and T becomes (T - S) = (V + 11 - S) = 15. Since the difference between U and V is 9, the difference between S and V becomes (U - V) - 9 = 15 - 9 = 6.

Hence, we cannot determine a unique difference between S and V's marks, but we can conclude that their difference lies within the range 6 to 15.

Based on this analysis:

1. Statement 1 alone is insufficient to determine the difference between S and V's marks.
2. Statement 2 alone is sufficient to establish a range for the difference between S and V's marks, but not to determine a unique value.
3. Either statement 1 or statement 2 is insufficient to find the difference between S and V's marks.
4. Statement 1 and statement 2 together do not provide enough information to find a unique difference between S and V's marks, as statement 2 only provides a range.

Therefore, the correct answer is: (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: B

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
Let's consider the statements one by one:

1. E is sitting to the right of H:
This statement tells us about the positions of E and H but does not give any information about G. So, we cannot determine who G is sitting opposite to based on this statement alone.

2. F is sitting opposite to H:
This statement tells us that F and H are seated across from each other. Since there are only four players, E and G must be seated next to each other but it doesn't specify where. However, since F is opposite to H, G must be sitting opposite to F.

Thus, statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question. Statement 1 is not necessary and even if combined with statement 2, it doesn't provide any additional information to determine the answer.

Therefore, the correct option is (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
If R is the niece of P, then Q, being the brother of R, could be either P's brother (and thus R's uncle) or P's son (and thus R's cousin). Without further information, it's impossible to determine whether Q is R's brother or not. Therefore, statement 1 is not sufficient.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
If S has one sister R, this doesn't provide any meaningful information about the relationship between R and Q since we don't know who S is. Thus, statement 2 alone is insufficient.

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 provides sufficient information on its own. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
Taking both statements together, we only know that R is the niece of P and that S has one sister R. But this doesn't help us determine the relationship between R and Q. Therefore, even when taken together, the statements are insufficient.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
As shown above, neither statement alone provides enough information, and neither do they when taken together. So, option E is the correct answer.

So, none of the provided statements alone or together provide enough information to determine whether Q is the brother of R.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

If we only know that only black ants can be found indoors (statement 1), this does not help us determine the total number of ants in the room. Even if we knew the number of red ants, it wouldn't matter because statement 1 states that red ants cannot be found indoors. Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

If we know that there are seven red ants in this room (statement 2), this still doesn't give us enough information to find the total number of ants. Red ants are not the only type of ants, so we cannot assume that there are no other types of ants present. Statement 2 alone is insufficient.

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 alone provides enough information to determine the total number of ants in the room. Statement 1 tells us about the type of ants, but not their quantity. Statement 2 tells us about the quantity of a specific type of ants, but not the total quantity. Therefore, neither statement 1 nor statement 2 is sufficient on its own.

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Since neither statement 1 nor statement 2 alone provides enough information, let's consider them together. Statement 1 tells us that only black ants can be found indoors, and statement 2 tells us that there are seven red ants in this room. Even with both statements, we still don't have enough information to determine the total number of ants in the room because we don't know if there are any black ants present.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

As we have determined in options A, B, and D, neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor both together provide enough information to determine the total number of ants in the room. Statement 1 does not give us any information about quantity, and statement 2 tells us about one type of ant but not the total quantity.

The correct option is (E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
Step 1: Analyze statement 1.
If the hour hand is between 5 and 6, then it could be any time between 5:00 and 5:59, as the hour hand takes 12 hours to complete a full circle, covering all 12 hours on the clock face. Therefore, statement 1 alone is not sufficient as it leaves us with a range of possibilities.

Step 2: Analyze statement 2.
If the clock shows a quarter past five, then the time is exactly 5:15. This is a specific time and leaves no room for ambiguity. Statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Step 3: Analyze the options in light of the above analysis.

(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient. (This option can be eliminated because statement 1 was found to be insufficient.)
(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient. (This is the correct option since statement 2 is indeed sufficient.)
(C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient. (This option is incorrect because statement 1 is not sufficient on its own.)
(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient. (This option is incorrect because statement 2 alone is already sufficient.)
(E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient. (This option can be eliminated because statement 2 alone is sufficient.)

So the correct answer is (B).

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
To answer the question, "P is towards which direction of Q?", let's analyze each statement:

Statement 1: Q is to the north of R, who is to the west of P.
This statement tells us that if we move from P towards the west, we will reach R, and if we continue moving in the same direction (north from R), we will reach Q. Therefore, Q is to the north of P. However, it doesn't give us information about the other directions. Hence, this statement alone is insufficient to determine if statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient, we choose answer choice (A).

Statement 2: P is to the north-west of S.
This statement does not provide any information about the location of Q. Hence, this statement alone is insufficient to determine the direction of Q from P. So, to be sure, we need to check if either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient. Since we have already determined that statement 1 is not sufficient on its own, now we know that statement 2 alone is also insufficient. We eliminate answer choices (B) and (C).

Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together:
With both statements, we now know that P is to the north-west of S, and Q is to the north of R, who is to the west of P. However, even with both statements, there is no information about the relative positioning of S, P, and Q in the other directions (east or south). Therefore, we still cannot determine the exact direction of Q from P using both statements.

We conclude that neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient. Thus, the correct answer is option (E).
Given answer: E

Correct answer: D
Let's analyze the given statements and options:

Statement 1: B has two brothers Nishant and Arav.
This statement tells us that A and B are not siblings since B has two brothers but there's no mention of a sister. However, this statement doesn't provide any information about the relationship between A and B through their family tree. So, statement 1 alone is not sufficient to answer how A is related to B.

Statement 2: A's father is the brother of Arav's mother.
This statement indicates that A's father and Arav's mother are siblings, which means A and Arav are cousins. As B is Arav's brother, it follows that A and B are cousins as well.

Now let's evaluate the options:

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient. -> We've determined that statement 1 alone is not sufficient.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient. -> This is correct. Statement 2 alone gives us the information we need to determine that A and B are cousins.

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient. -> Since statement 1 alone is not sufficient, this option cannot be correct.

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient. -> This would be correct if neither statement alone were sufficient, but statement 2 alone is sufficient.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient. -> Since statement 2 alone is indeed sufficient, we can eliminate this option.

So, based on the reasoning above, the correct answer is (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient to show that A and B are cousins.
Given answer: B


<s>[INST]What time does the bus leave for the airport today? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Buses usually depart on time.
2. The scheduled arrival is at 11:40 a.m.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E

The correct option is (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Here's the reasoning:
1. Statement 1: Buses usually depart on time. This statement doesn't give us a specific departure time, so it is not enough to answer the question about the bus leaving for the airport today.
2. Statement 2: The scheduled arrival is at 11:40 a.m. This statement tells us that the bus is scheduled to arrive at the airport at 11:40 a.m., which means the bus likely leaves earlier than that to arrive on time. Therefore, with this information, we can determine the approximate departure time for the bus.
3. Statement 1 does not provide any new information beyond the general assumption of buses usually being on time. Statement 2, on the other hand, gives specific, relevant information about the situation.
4. Thus, it can be concluded that statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question, while statement 1 is insufficient.

Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer: Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: B


<s>[INST]Is Ajay the only son of Aparna? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Aparna's brother has only one nephew.
2. Ruhi is Ajay’s sister.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
Step 1: Analyze Statement 1 - "Aparna's brother has only one nephew."
This statement tells us that Aparna has at most one brother and Ajay is his only nephew. This does not give us any information about whether Ajay is Aparna's only son or not. Thus, Statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Step 2: Analyze Statement 2 - "Ruhi is Ajay’s sister."
This statement tells us that Ajay has a sister named Ruhi. However, it does not give us any information about whether Ajay is Aparna's only son or not. Thus, Statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Step 3: Analyze combining both statements - 
Now let's consider both statements together. Even with these two statements, we do not have enough information to conclude that Ajay is Aparna's only son. Statement 1 only tells us about Aparna's brother's side of the family, and Statement 2 gives us information about Ajay's sibling, but it does not rule out the possibility of Aparna having other children. 

So, neither Statement 1 nor Statement 2 alone is sufficient, and even when taken together, they are insufficient to answer the question.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
Given answer: E


<s>[INST]How many students are sitting in a row facing the board? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Kavya, who is fifth from the left end, is ninth to the left of Aadesh who is seventh from the right end.
2. Jagrav is eighth to the right of Neerja, who is sixteenth from the right end and fifth from the left end.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
1. From statement 1, we know that Aadesh is 7th from the right end and Kavya is 5th from the left end, and Kavya is to the left of Aadesh. This means that there are 5+9=14 students sitting to the left of Aadesh, including Kavya and herself. Since Aadesh is 7th from the right end, there are 21-7=14 students sitting to the right of Aadesh, including himself. Therefore, there are a total of 14+14+1=29 students sitting in a row. So, statement 1 alone is sufficient to answer the question.
2. From statement 2, we know that Neerja is 16th from the right end and 5th from the left end. So, there are 15 students sitting to the right of Neerja, and 4 students sitting to her left, making a total of 19 students. Jagrav is 8th to the right of Neerja, so there are 8 students sitting between Jagrav and Neerja (including both). Since Neerja is 5th from the left end, and there are 8 students between Jagrav and Neerja, Jagrav must be the 13th student from the left end. That means there are 12 students sitting to the left of Jagrav, and 13 students sitting to his right (including himself). So, there are a total of 12+13+1=26 students sitting in a row.

However, we cannot determine if statement 2 alone is sufficient because there is a discrepancy in the information provided in statement 2. The statement says that Neerja is both 16th from the right end and 5th from the left end, but this is not possible as there are only 26 students in total (which we calculated above). This means that there is an inconsistency in the information provided in statement 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is option (A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: A

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
1. Statement 1: Blue is called green, white is called black, brown is called purple. This statement does not provide enough information to determine the color of a fresh tomato, because the color red is not mentioned. So this statement is insufficient.

2. Statement 2: Yellow is called white, red is called orange, green is called brown. This statement indicates that red is called orange. A fresh tomato is typically red in color. Therefore, we can determine that a fresh tomato would be called "orange" in the game. Hence, statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Explanation for other possibilities:
(A) and (C) are incorrect because statement 1 is insufficient.
(D) is not considered because taking both statements together isn't necessary as statement 2 alone is sufficient.
(E) is also not considered because statement 2 alone is indeed sufficient to answer the question.

<s>[INST]Kubera, the wealthy king of the Yakshas, liked all things made of gold and silver. The king decided to gift every Yaksha family a spherical globe made of solid gold with a cylindrical silver rod passing through its center. His goldsmith told him that this would require a 6 cm long, perfectly cylindrical hole to be bored through each perfectly spherical golden globe in order to insert the silver piece. Only the gold surrounding the curved surface of the silver cylinder would be retained. Kubera wanted the silver rod to be inserted but he was worried that gold was going to have to be removed from each of the globes. The goldsmith assured him that there would still be a fair bit of gold still left after the drilling.
What was the remaining volume of the golden globe, after drilling, when it was ready to be inserted with the silver rod?
Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Each silver rod was perfectly aligned perfectly with the vertical axis of the globe.
2. The diameter of the silver rod was exactly 1.25 cm.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (F) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(F). The question can be answered without either statement.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: F
Let's consider each statement individually:

1. Each silver rod was perfectly aligned perfectly with the vertical axis of the globe.

This statement tells us about the orientation of the silver rod in relation to the golden globe, but it doesn't provide any information about the dimensions of the rod or the globe, making it insufficient to find the remaining volume of the golden globe.

2. The diameter of the silver rod is exactly 1.25 cm.

This statement gives us the diameter of the silver rod, so we can calculate its radius. However, it doesn't provide any information about the size of the golden globe. The volume of the remaining gold depends on the size of the sphere, so this statement alone is not sufficient to find the remaining volume.

Since neither statement provides enough information on its own, let's consider them together:

If we know the diameter (or radius) of the silver rod and that it's aligned with the vertical axis of the golden globe, we can imagine the drilling process as removing a cylindrical section from the sphere.

The remaining volume of the golden globe can be found by subtracting the volume of the cylindrical section drilled out from the volume of the original spherical gold globe.

Let's denote the radius of the gold sphere by R and the radius of the silver rod by r. The volume Vc of the cylindrical section removed is given as:

Vc = π * r^2 * h

where h is the height of the cylindrical hole and is equal to 6 cm (length of the silver rod).

The remaining volume Vol of the golden globe can be obtained by subtracting the volume of the cylindrical section from the volume of the sphere (With radius R):

Vol = (4/3 * π * R^3) - Vc
Vol = (4/3 * π * R^3) - (π * r^2 * h)

Knowing r and h from statement 2 and R from the fact that the sphere is just large enough to contain the rod, we can calculate Vol.

Since both statements together provide enough information, the correct answer is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
Given answer: D

2. The book has 380 pages out of which three-fifths were read by Wednesday.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient:

Statement 1 is not sufficient because it only tells us about the pages read on Friday and doesn't give any information about the pages read on Thursday.

Statement 2, however, gives us information about the total number of pages in the book and how much was read by Wednesday. However, it doesn't provide any details about the pages read on Thursday. Therefore, statement 2 alone is insufficient.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient:
As explained above, statement 1 does not provide enough information to determine the number of pages read on Thursday.

Statement 2, while providing useful information, does not specifically mention Thursday. If three-fifths of the book was read by Wednesday, that still leaves one-fifth of the book unaccounted for, which could include or exclude Thursday's reading. Statement 2 alone is insufficient.

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient:
Neither statement 1 nor 2 alone provides enough information to determine the number of pages read on Thursday. So, this option is incorrect.

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient:
Combining both statements still does not give a direct answer to the question as neither statement provides direct information about Thursday's readings.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient:
Since neither statement 1 nor 2 alone provides enough information and combining both statements also doesn't provide enough information, option E is the correct answer.

No definite answer can be given regarding the number of pages read on Thursday based on the given statements.

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
Here is how to approach this question:

(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
This option suggests that if Karan said he had one sister, that would be enough to conclude that Karan is related to Jhanvi as siblings. However, statement 2 is not considered here. It's possible that Jhanvi could be lying or mistaken about having only one brother. Therefore, statement 1 alone cannot be sufficient.

(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
This option suggests that if Jhanvi said she had one brother, that would be enough to conclude that Karan is related to Jhanvi as siblings. However, statement 1 is not considered here. It's possible that Karan could be lying or mistaken about having only one sister. Therefore, statement 2 alone cannot be sufficient.

(C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
This option suggests that either of the two statements would be enough to conclude that Karan is related to Jhanvi as siblings. As analyzed in (A) and (B), neither statement can be sufficient alone because there are scenarios where one of them might be lying or mistaken. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
If both Karan and Jhanvi independently confirm that they have only one sibling, then it becomes a logical conclusion that they are siblings to each other. Since neither statement alone provides enough information to confirm their relationship with certainty, combining the two statements would provide sufficient information.

(E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
This option assumes that neither statement nor both statements together offer enough information to determine if Karan is related to Jhanvi. But as discussed in option (D), when taken together, the statements provide enough information to draw the conclusion.

The correct answer is therefore option (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
Given answer: D

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
1. Statement 1: Each girl has twice as many sisters as brothers.

This statement doesn't give us an exact number of girls, but it gives us information about the ratio of sisters to brothers. It implies that there must be at least 2 girls (since having only 1 girl would mean she has twice as many brothers as sisters, which contradicts the statement). However, it doesn't provide enough information to definitively say how many girls there are.

Insufficient.

2. Statement 2: The youngest child is a boy and he has 3 sisters.

This statement directly tells us that there are 3 girls in the family. We don't need any more information to answer the question based on this statement.

Sufficient.

However, the question asks which statement(s) are sufficient, so we must consider both options.

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient. Incorrect because Statement 2 is sufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient. Correct.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient. Incorrect because only Statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient. Incorrect because Statement 2 alone is sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient. Incorrect because Statement 2 alone is sufficient.

So the correct answer is (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

<s>[INST]At the finals of the All India Logic competition, the announcer displays six words:  MOSS, DRAG, CULT, CHOP, TRIM, GUTS. Each of the 4 finalists, representing the 4 regional champions within India (North, South, East & West), is given an envelope. Each of those 4 envelopes bear one distinct letter from one of those six words. All those distinct letters in the three envelopes are chosen from the same word. The contestants are forbidden from disclosing the letter in their envelope to anybody else. Each contestant has to determine the chosen word from the list of six.
The announcer asks the Eastern contestant, Durga, whether she can deduce the word. She instantly replies, “Yes!” Without asking her to identify the word, the announcer now moves to the regional champion from the North, Lakshmi and asks her whether she can identify the word. She thinks for a few seconds and then breaks into a smile, “Yes, I know the word.”
What is the word?
Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1.After Lakshmi, the announcer now looks at the contestant from the West and asks, “Saraswati , what about you?” Within moments, she too breaks into a smile and nods, “I know the word!”
2. The last person to answer is Meenakshi. She says, “Now I also know the word.”

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
1. Statement 1: When Durga from the East knows the word, it means that the word is such that the distinct letter in her envelope, when combined with the word, forms a new word that is unique to that word. This means that there is only one word in the list that can be formed by adding the letter from Durga's envelope to her envelope's distinct letter. Since Lakshmi from the North also nods, this means that the word can also be identified using the distinct letter in her envelope. Thus, the letter in Lakshmi's envelope must also have only one word in the list that can be formed by adding the letter from Lakshmi's envelope to her envelope's distinct letter. Only one word fits for both - CULT. If there were another word that fit the condition, Saraswati from the West wouldn't have been able to identify the word after knowing Durga and Lakshmi's envelopes.

Logic for statement 1 being sufficient: After analyzing the information from Durga and Lakshmi, Saraswati can come to the conclusion that there is only one word that fits the condition - CULT.
Logic against statement 1 being sufficient: We don't have full information about Saraswati's envelope.

However, Saraswati's envelope is not needed for our conclusion as Durga and Lakshmi's envelopes are enough to pin-point the word as CULT.

2. Statement 2: Meenakshi is the last one and only restates that she also knows the word. This doesn't add any new information to the puzzle, as we have already concluded that the word is CULT based on Durga and Lakshmi's envelopes. We don't need any information from Meenakshi's envelope, so it's irrelevant in this case.

Logic for statement 2 being sufficient: N/A, the statement doesn't add any new information.
Logic against statement 2 being sufficient: N/A, the statement doesn't add any new information.

Conclusion: Both statements, considered individually, give us an idea about the abilities of the other contestants, but they don't add any new information to conclude the word. Using the information from Durga and Lakshmi, Saraswati could've come to the conclusion about the word even without Meenakshi's redundant indication. Therefore, the correct option is (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient. However, as seen, statement 1 isn't required to find the word.

(F). The question can be answered without either statement.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: F

Step 1: Analyze statement 1 - "Vighnesh likes to relax by watching YouTube videos."
This statement does not provide information about Vighnesh's preference for computer programming or playing video games directly. It only shows that he likes to relax with YouTube videos. Therefore, this statement is not sufficient to conclude that Vighnesh likes computer programming and playing video games.

Step 2: Analyze statement 2 - "Vighnesh likes mathematics."
Although this statement provides information about Vighnesh's interest in mathematics, it doesn't necessarily imply that he likes computer programming and playing video games. Computer programming and video games might not be related to mathematics for some individuals.

Step 3: Analyze if either statement is sufficient.
Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 provides direct evidence that Vighnesh likes computer programming and playing video games. Therefore, we cannot conclude that either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient for answering the question.

Step 4: Analyze if both statements are sufficient together.
When both statements are considered together, it still does not provide conclusive evidence that Vighnesh likes computer programming and playing video games. Statement 1 talks about watching YouTube videos and statement 2 talks about liking mathematics, neither of which confirms a preference for computer programming and video games.

Step 5: Analyze if the question can be answered without either statement.
Since the question asks about Vighnesh's preferences for computer programming and video games, without either statement, we cannot answer this question.

Conclusion:
We can eliminate options (A), (B), (C), and (F). While (C) seems plausible at first, a closer examination reveals that neither statement actually provides sufficient evidence for answering the question.

Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
To determine if A is heavier than B, we need to compare their weights relative to each other. Let's evaluate the given statements to see if they provide sufficient information:

1. A is not lighter than C: This statement does not provide any information about the relationship between A and B, so it is not sufficient on its own.

2. D weighs the same as A and B is heavier than D: This statement tells us that A and D have the same weight, and that B is heavier than D. Since D and A have the same weight, and B is heavier than D, it follows that B is also heavier than A.

Thus, considering the statements individually:
(A) Statement 1 alone is insufficient, as it does not provide any information about the relationship between A and B.
(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient, as it directly compares A and B through an indirect route (A's relationship to D and then D's relationship to B).

Therefore, the correct answer is (B): Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E

Step 1: Analyze statement 1.
Statement 1 gives us the information:
- 'apo fu qe nane' means 'mango leaf is long'
- 'nane ko' means 'long stick'

From this statement, we can infer that 'nane' might mean 'long'. However, statement 1 does not provide any direct information about the word for 'leaf'. It only gives us the relation between 'mango leaf', 'long', and 'stick'. Therefore, statement 1 alone is not sufficient to answer the question.

Step 2: Analyze statement 2.
Statement 2 gives us the information:
- 'apo qe lans' means 'green mango leaf'
- 'ka lans' means 'green book'

From this statement, we can see that 'lans' means 'green' and 'apo qe' could possibly mean 'mango'. Together, we can infer that 'apo qe lans' might mean 'green mango leaf'. Since 'nane' in statement 1 meant 'long', and there is no other word given for 'leaf', we can infer that 'lans' might also mean 'leaf'. Therefore, with this information, we can answer that 'lans' means 'leaf'.

Step 3: Choose the correct option.
Since statement 1 alone is insufficient, and statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question, the correct option is:
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: B


<s>[INST]On which date of the month was Jayant born in December 2012? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Jayant's birthday is on an even date of the month.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Logic for this option:
- Statement 1 tells us that Jayant's birthday is on an even date of the month. In December, the even dates are the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, 20th, 22nd, 24th, 26th, 28th and 30th. This reduces the possibilities significantly but still leaves many options. Statement 1 is not enough to determine Jayant's exact birth date.
- However, we don't need to consider Statement 2 because if we can prove that Statement 1 is insufficient on its own, then there's no need to evaluate Statement 2.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Logic for this option:
- Statement 2 tells us that the day of the month on which Jayant was born is a prime number. The only prime number days in December are the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 11th, 13th, 17th, 19th, 23rd and 31st. This greatly reduces the possibilities, but it doesn't definitively tell us which of these dates is Jayant's birthday. Statement 2 is not enough to determine Jayant's exact birth date.

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Logic for this option:
- Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 is sufficient on its own, as we've already determined. Therefore, option C is incorrect.

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Logic for this option:
- When considering both statements together, we find that only one date fits both conditions: the 23rd of December. It's an even number and a prime number. So, although neither statement 1 nor statement 2 is sufficient alone, when combined, they are indeed sufficient to pinpoint Jayant's birth date.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Logic for this option:
- As we've seen, when taken together, statements 1 and 2 are actually sufficient to find Jayant's birth date, so option E cannot be correct.

Conclusion:
Thus, the correct answer is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to answer the question.
Given answer: D


<s>[INST]A water pump pumps water at a uniform rate. How long does it take to fill the tank? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. In half an hour, seven-twelfths of the tank is filled.
2. The pump is switched on at 9:00 a.m.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
1. In half an hour, seven-twelfths of the tank is filled: This statement gives us information about the rate at which the pump fills the tank. Since the pump fills seven-twelfths of the tank in half an hour, we can calculate that it takes 1 hour to fill the entire tank (by dividing the total amount filled by the time taken, i.e., 12/7 = 1.71 hours, so approximately 1 hour). Therefore, statement 1 alone is sufficient.

2. The pump is switched on at 9:00 a.m.: This statement only provides us with information about when the pump was switched on but does not give us any idea about the rate at which the pump works. Therefore, statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Since statement 1 is sufficient on its own, we don't need to consider the combined sufficiency of both statements.

The correct answer is (A): Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: A


<s>[INST]How long was the CEO's speech? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. The CEO spoke 30 words per minute.
2. Had the CEO spoken 5 fewer words per minute her speech would have lasted 4 more minutes.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
Step 1: Analyze Statement 1.
If the CEO spoke 30 words per minute, this information alone does not give us the total length of the speech, as we do not know the total number of words spoken. Therefore, Statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Step 2: Analyze Statement 2.
Had the CEO spoken 5 fewer words per minute, her speech would have lasted 4 more minutes. This gives us a relationship between words spoken and time taken, but we don't have the actual numbers, making Statement 2 insufficient on its own.

Step 3: Analyze Statement 1 and Statement 2 together.
Using Statement 2, we can set up an equation to find the total number of words spoken: W = 30 * T (where W is the number of words and T is the time in minutes).
From Statement 2, we know that if the CEO spoke 5 fewer words per minute, she would have spoken W - 5 words and the time would be (T + 4) minutes. Substituting W = 30 * T into this equation gives us (30 * T - 5) * (T + 4) = W * (T + 4), which simplifies to 30T - 5 = (W - 5) * (T + 4). We now have a system of two equations – the first one being W = 30 * T and the second one being 30T - 5 = (W - 5) * (T + 4).
Solving this system of equations, we can find both the total number of words spoken and the length of the speech. Hence, Statement 1 and Statement 2 taken together are sufficient to answer the question.

Step 4: Conclusion
Taking the above steps into consideration, the correct answer is (D). Statement 1 and Statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
Given answer: D


<s>[INST]How many daughters does Devi have? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. X's father has 3 children.
2. Y is X's sister and daughter of Devi.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
1. Statement 1 says that X's father has 3 children. This statement doesn't provide any direct information about Devi's daughters. We cannot conclude how many daughters Devi has based on this statement alone.

2. Statement 2 says that Y is X's sister and daughter of Devi. This statement tells us that Devi is a mother and she has at least one daughter, Y. However, it does not provide enough information to determine if Devi has any other daughters.

Combining both statements:
While statement 2 tells us that Devi has one daughter, statement 1 does not give us any information about Devi specifically. Therefore, we cannot determine if the three children mentioned in statement 1 all belong to Devi.

Therefore, none of the statements alone are sufficient to answer the question about the number of daughters Devi has. And even when taken together, they still do not provide sufficient information.

So, the correct answer is (E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
Given answer: E

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E

1. Statement 1: Anjali is taller than Arun and Kartik.

This statement only gives us information about Anjali's height relative to Arun and Kartik. It does not provide enough information to determine who the tallest person is because we don't know how she compares to Ritika and Vishwesh. So, statement 1 alone is insufficient.

2. Statement 2: Arun is shorter than Ritika but taller than Vishwesh.

This statement gives us information about Arun's height relative to Ritika and Vishwesh, but it does not provide enough information to determine who the tallest person is because we don't know how Arun compares to Anjali and Kartik. So, statement 2 alone is also insufficient.

However, if we take both statements together, we can deduce the order of heights from tallest to shortest. From statement 1, we know that Anjali is taller than at least Arun and Kartik. From statement 2, we know that Ritika is taller than Arun. Therefore, the order of heights must be: Ritika, Anjali, Arun, Kartik, Vishwesh (or a subset thereof). Thus, Anjali is the tallest.

Therefore, option (D) is correct. Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
Given answer: D

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D

(1) Statement 1: X's father is married to Z.
This statement tells us that Z is related to X, but it doesn't directly provide a relationship between X and Y. If X and Y are siblings through Z, then this would be enough information. However, without knowing more about Y's family, we cannot definitively say that statement 1 alone is sufficient.

(2) Statement 2: Y is the daughter of Z, who has a son and daughter.
This statement tells us about Y's family, but it doesn't mention X at all. So we cannot determine any relationship between X and Y based solely on this information.

Taking both statements together, we know that Z is connected to both X and Y. From statement 1, X is related to Z through marriage (X's father), and from statement 2, Y is a child of Z. Given that Z has both a son and a daughter, it's possible that Y is X's sister (or vice versa), but the given statements do not provide enough information to confirm this.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
Step 1: Analyze statement 1: "A plays hockey." This statement tells us that A is not playing cricket, but it doesn't give us enough information about B, C, or D to determine who plays cricket. So, statement 1 alone is not sufficient.

Step 2: Analyze statement 2: "C plays neither chess nor football." This statement means that C is not playing cricket, but again, it doesn't tell us anything about A, B, or D playing cricket. So, statement 2 alone is not sufficient.

Step 3: Analyze both statements together. Now, we know that A and C are not playing cricket. But this still doesn't provide enough information to identify who plays cricket.

Answer: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor both together are sufficient to answer which person plays cricket. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

<s>[INST]How much does a clock lose in a day? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. The clock shows 7:45 a.m.
2. The hour and minute hands coincide every 63 minutes starting at noon.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
1. The fact that the clock shows 7:45 a.m. does not give any information about how much the clock loses in a day. It only provides the current time shown by the clock. There is no way to determine if the clock is fast, slow, or accurate based on this information. Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient.

2. This statement means that the clock's minute hand moves ahead of its correctly synchronized position with the hour hand every 63 minutes. It takes exactly 12 hours * 5 minutes = 60 minutes for the hour hand to move from one number to another. For the minute hand, it takes only 5 minutes to move from one number to another. This discrepancy between the movement of the two hands results in the clock showing the incorrect time.

Now, since the minute hand moves 5 minutes ahead of the correct time every full cycle of the hour hand, in 12 hours, the minute hand will be ahead by 5*12 = 60 minutes or 1 hour. Therefore, the clock will lose 1 hour in 12 hours. Hence, in 24 hours, the clock will lose (24/12) * 60 minutes = 120 minutes or 2 hours.

Therefore, statement 2 is sufficient to answer the question.

We don't need to consider both statements together because statement 2 alone is enough to provide the answer.

So, the correct answer is :

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: B

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
To evaluate the sufficiency of each statement, let's consider the given options:

1. There is one tabla instructor for each of the 52 classes held in this city

This statement provides a direct correlation between the number of classes and the number of tabla instructors. If there's one instructor per class, then we can determine the number of instructors based on the total number of classes.

However, this statement doesn't provide any information about the students each instructor teaches. It could be that some instructors teach more than one student, or it could be that they all teach the same number of students. Since we cannot determine whether each instructor teaches only one student or multiple students, we cannot definitively answer the question based on this statement alone.

2. Each tabla instructor teaches 5 students.

This statement provides information about the student-to-instructor ratio but does not mention anything about the total number of classes or instructors. Therefore, this statement alone is insufficient to determine the number of tabla instructors in the city.

Now, let's evaluate the combinations:

Combining both statements, we have a connection between the number of classes and the number of instructors, as well as the number of students taught per instructor. With this combined information, we can calculate the number of tabla instructors by dividing the total number of classes (52) by the number of students per instructor (5), assuming that each instructor teaches the same number of students and there are no unexpected variations in the class sizes.

Therefore, neither statement individually provides a definitive answer, but their combination can lead us to an answer. Thus, the correct option is:

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
Given answer: D


<s>[INST]There are two hospitals. One of them is near me while the other is far away. In which of the hospitals will there be more male births than female births? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. 50.9% of all babies born in a given year are male while 49.1% are female.
2. The nearby hospital has a small maternity ward while the one far away has a much larger maternity ward.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D

The correct option is (A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Here's the logic:

(A). Statement 1 gives us the percentage distribution of male and female births in a given year, which is approximately 50.9% males and 49.1% females. This distribution is consistent across all hospitals, whether near or far. Therefore, it provides a sufficient answer to the question even without considering statement 2.

On the other hand, statement 2 only talks about the sizes of the maternity wards in the two hospitals, not about the gender distribution of births. Thus, statement 2 alone cannot answer the question.

Therefore, the correct option is (A). 

(B), (C), and (E) can be eliminated because they make assumptions about statement 1 being insufficient or about statement 2 providing enough information. Since statement 1 alone is sufficient, these options are incorrect. Statement 2 alone is insufficient, so option (C) cannot be correct.

Therefore, the correct option is (A): Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
1. Statement 1: C is B's spouse.
This statement only tells us about the relationship between C and B, but it does not provide any information about A. So, we cannot conclude if A is B's brother based on this statement alone.

2. Statement 2: A is C's relative.
This statement tells us about the relationship between A and C, but it doesn't give us any direct information about B. However, since C is B's spouse, if A is a relative of C, then it is possible that A is also a relative of B (which could include being a brother). But this is not certain, as there could be other relationships like cousin, uncle, etc.

Either statement 1 or statement 2 is insufficient on their own, so we need to consider both statements together.

Now when we consider both statements together, it's feasible that A is a brother of B, given that C is the spouse of B and A is a relative of C. However, it's still not 100% certain because A could be related to C through another family line, not directly through B.

Therefore, neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor both together provide enough certainty to conclude that A is B's brother.

So, the correct answer is (E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

[/INST]


Correct answer: A
1. Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

If we are only told that 2343 single-person tickets were bought, we don't know if the stadium can accommodate all of these fans. So statement 1 alone is not sufficient.

2. Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

If we are only told that the stadium can seat 2600 fans, we don't know how many tickets have been sold. The stadium could be filled to capacity, or there could be empty seats. So statement 2 alone is not sufficient.

3. Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Statement 1 is not sufficient on its own, and neither is statement 2. So this option is not correct.

4. Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

If we combine both statements, we have enough information to answer the question. All 2343 ticket holders could fit into the stadium, but we cannot say for sure unless we know if any of them were no-shows. However, we do know for certain that the stadium itself was not a limiting factor, because it can seat 2600 fans. Therefore, it can be said that taken together, statements 1 and 2 are sufficient.

5. Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Since statements 1 and 2 taken together are sufficient, this option is not correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

[/INST]


Correct answer: D
1. Statement 1: M is not younger than P and O is older than N.

This statement tells us that O is older than N, but it doesn't provide any information about M and P's ages. Therefore, we cannot determine if M or P (or both) are older than O.
Statement 1 alone is insufficient.

2. Statement 2: P is older than exactly two friends.

This statement tells us that P is older than two of the friends, but it doesn't specify who those two friends are. It could be M and N, in which case O would be the third friend and younger than P. Or it could be N and O, in which case M would be the one left out and younger than P. We cannot definitively say that O is one of the two friends based on this statement alone.
Statement 2 alone is insufficient.

However, when considering both statements together, we can deduce the answer. From statement 1, we know that O is older than N. From statement 2, we know that P is older than exactly two friends. By combining these two pieces of information, we can conclude that P must be older than both M and N and not younger than any of the others. Thus, O must be the fourth friend, and the only one who is not older than P.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Statement 1: Neither S nor T pairs with either Q or R.
This statement tells us that Q and R are not paired with S and T. However, this doesn't help determine the pairs, as we already know P doesn't pair with Q or R.
Statement 1 is insufficient.

Statement 2: Neither P nor Q pairs with either S or U.
This statement informs us which socks from the Q, S, U set aren't paired with P or Q. As a result, it implies that P must pair with either R or U (it can't pair with Q or S). If P pairs with U, then the final pair would be R and T (or S) since R cannot pair with Q or S. If P pairs with R, the final pair would be S and T, as T cannot pair with Q or R.
Therefore, statement 2 is sufficient.

Correct option: (B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
