She would have known the value of the baseball, and she had heard the conversation between Mr. Plympton and Crusher Davis, so she would have known that it was intended to go to Crusher Davis. She also knew that the baseball would not be missed until it was too late for her to retrieve it. She needed the money and was desperate to have it. She had been overheard by Crusher Davis talking to the pawnbroker, Al, and she was desperate to get the money to redeem the pledge. So Crusher Davis had to act quickly.

The burglar must have been in the shop between 10:10 p.m. and 5:22 a.m. Ed said, “I suspect one of them quit running when the thief broke down the door or broke the display case.” The grandfather clock was on the corner farthest from the cash register and broken display case. Therefore, it could not be the grandfather clock. The pocket watch was in a display case by the front window. Nothing in that case was affected by my visitor … it’s too far from the center of the room. The mantle clock was on the floor. It took a pretty good lick. There’s a dent in the wooden floor, but it’s made of heavy brass and only has a slight scratch. I have to accept a little bit of blame for that one being on the floor.
