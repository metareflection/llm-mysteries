# llm-mysteries

## Highlights

### Attempt 1
- Base lines are generated by [main](main.py) and [main_gpt](main__gpt.py).

### Attempt 2
- [graph](graph.py) asks the LLM for exonerating and incriminating evidence for each suspect and symbolically combines the result.

### Attempt 3
Inspired by [_LMs for Rationality_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14250),
- [mystery](mystery.py) transforms a belief graph into a MaxSAT problem to be optimized for debugging consistency;
- [belief_graph](graph.py) elicits a belief graph for a story.

## Libraries

- [tms](tms.py) is a basic probabilistic Truth-Maintenance System (TMS) with a MaxSAT backend.
