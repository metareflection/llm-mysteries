The police questioned all four but couldn't find any evidence to charge any of them with the crime. It had to be one of them, though, because no one else could get by our security. I mean, there’s only one entry to the store and it had an alarm that would go off if opened. Each window had alarms on them, too. The only entryway not alarmed was Rufus' doggy door, but there was an outside camera that kept watch on that. Dad also had an x-ray scanner that all employees had to go through after each shift so that nothing could be smuggled out in a bag or in their clothing.

### Answer

The murderer is Ed the Bludgeoner.

The reason is because the murderer must be a man who could kill Holmes in a single blow.

And the only one who can do that is Ed the Bludgeoner, who is used to killing people with a single blow from his bludgeon.

The other three murderers would have to kill Holmes with a more complicated plan, and the problem is that Holmes would have already seen through the plan and escaped by the time they were ready to kill him.
