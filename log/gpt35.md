Based on the information provided in the story, we can deduce who the culprit is by following these steps:

1. Tom White received a can of popcorn from his uncle.
2. He brought the popcorn to the hooch and left it by his bunk.
3. While Tom was on guard duty from 1900 to 2100 hours, one of his buddies took the popcorn.
4. Macnamara went to play ball with B squad after chow.
5. Locke went to the other side of the camp to watch a movie with his M-16 rifle.
6. Henson had a couple of beers down at the club.
7. Mosier went to the showers and washed his clothes.

Based on this information, we can eliminate Macnamara, as he was playing ball during the time the popcorn went missing. Similarly, we can also eliminate Locke, as he was watching the movie on the other side of the camp. Henson and Mosier are the remaining suspects.

8. Henson, with beer on his breath, mentioned that the guilty person had already been dressed down and would return the remaining popcorn with an apology.
9. Henson chose not to provide an alibi or explanation for his activities during that time.

From these observations, it can be inferred that Henson is the culprit who took the popcorn while Tom was on guard duty. Henson's lack of an alibi and his guilty demeanor indicate his involvement.

Based on the information provided, the possible suspects are Mr. Ferguson, Mrs. Yee, Dexter, and Skyler. 

Step 1: Consider Mr. Ferguson as a suspect. Although he is an avid Curious George fan, there is no clear motive for him to steal the book. He visits the library every day and is upset when the book is not available. Also, it is mentioned that he dislikes children, but there is no evidence that he would steal a book for that reason.

Step 2: Consider Mrs. Yee as a suspect. She threatens to feed the book to her dog to keep Mr. Ferguson away from the library. However, it is unlikely that she would steal the book just to inconvenience him. Additionally, she is the librarian and it would be suspicious for her to steal a book from her own library.

Step 3: Consider Dexter as a suspect. He laughs when Mrs. Yee threatens to feed the book to her dog, suggesting that he may have stolen it. He also has knowledge of the library's anti-crime system and could potentially manipulate it. However, there is no clear motive stated for his actions.

Step 4: Consider Skyler as a suspect. He kicks Mr. Ferguson in the shins and may have a grudge against him. He also stands to gain by keeping the book away from Mr. Ferguson, as it appears to be something he desires. However, Skyler is only seven years old, and it would be difficult for him to manipulate the anti-crime system or hide the book effectively.

Based on the information given, Dexter is the most likely culprit. He has knowledge of the anti-crime system and laughs when Mrs. Yee suggests stealing the book. However, it is important to note that this conclusion is based on the information provided in the story, and additional evidence could potentially change the outcome.

Based on the information provided in the story, the culprit who has the traitor's map is Lucius. 

Firstly, Nate passed four men on the road: Edward, Lucius, Benjamin, and Jonathan. 

Edward, the first traveler, seems unlikely to be the culprit as he is described as an old man who has been farming the land for 15 years. He is wearing a heavy cotton shirt and does not seem to match the description of the British major who disguised himself in American clothing. 

Lucius, the second traveler, is described as a young man in a thin brown shirt and leather vest. He is angry at the soldiers, supports the British, and hopes for their victory. This behavior, along with his sullen attitude and opposition to the American army, suggests that he could be the traitor.

Benjamin, the third traveler, appears to be friendly and does not display any suspicious behavior. He mentions his plans to visit his nephew in Charleston and is looking for a shady spot to eat lunch, indicating a non-threatening presence.

Based on the information provided in the story, we can deduce that the culprit who stole the Robe of the Saints is Morgan Grant. Here are the key steps of the deduction:

1. Godefroi, the villien responsible for guarding the chest, fell asleep and woke to find the chains unfastened. He summoned the guard, and it was discovered that the Robe of the Saints was missing from the chest.

2. The theft could only have occurred while the ship was still at sea, as they had not docked since the theft. Therefore, the thief is still on board.

3. The author, who is tasked with finding the culprit discreetly, rules out nearly everyone as they could prove their innocence by being in the company of others when Godefroi was given his supper.

4. The only remaining suspects are Captain Fosters, Sir Francis Walters, and Morgan Grant, who were not accounted for during the time of the theft.

5. Captain Fosters claims to have stayed in his cabin due to the rocky sail. His reason seems legitimate and does not raise suspicion.

6. Sir Francis Walters states that he got drunk during the storm to cope with his fear. While his behavior may be unusual, it does not provide a motive or direct evidence of theft.

7. Morgan Grant, on the other hand, spent the evening in private prayer. This behavior suggests a possible motive, as he could have used the opportunity to steal the robe unnoticed.

8. The author concludes that Morgan Grant is the culprit and expresses confidence that Sir Francis can recover the stolen robe with persuasive methods.

Based on the information provided, it is not explicitly stated who the killer is. However, it can be inferred based on the narrative. 

Here are the facts we know:
1. Tom Patrick and three other soldiers were in a small cell together.
2. One night, a Union guard was found dead in their cell.
3. The guard was killed for food, as bartering for food was common in the prison camps.
4. Sgt. McCool, an Irishman, interrogated the four soldiers to find the guilty party.

From the interrogation and search conducted by Sgt. McCool, we can gather some clues:

1. Tom Patrick:
- Found with a small cube of rancid pork, indicating he had access to food.
- No incriminating evidence found upon inspection of his person or clothing.
- Tom's survival and the fact that he is telling the story suggests he may not be the killer.

2. Pvt. Jack Trueblood:
- Found with a cornhusk in his pocket and a dirty diary.
- No incriminating evidence found upon inspection of his person or clothing.
- Displayed fearful demeanor and had visible injuries, indicating he may not be the killer.

3. Sgt. Patrick Culpepper:
- Obnoxious and cocky attitude.
- Claimed to be practically blind without his glasses, which were lost.
- No incriminating evidence found upon inspection of his person or clothing.

4. Pvt. Billy Calhoun:
- Emaciated and afraid, indicating he may not be the killer.
- Found with dirt in both trouser pockets and worn-out boots.
- A small bruise about ¾ inch in diameter found on his left bicep.

Based on the clues provided, it is implied that Pvt. Billy Calhoun is the guilty party. The dusty consistency of the dirt in his pockets and his worn-out boots suggest that he dug into the ground to hide the stolen food. The small bruise on his arm also indicates a physical struggle with the guard during the murder.

April Park correctly identifies the killer as Billy Calhoun, demonstrating her deductive reasoning skills.

Based on the information provided, the most likely culprit is Cynthia Hogarth, the CFO of Wonder Cream. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The crime occurred between 5:00 pm and 7:00 pm on Saturday evening.
2. Diane, the CEO, found the company safe open and discovered that the security video for that time period was erased and turned off.
3. Bob, Kristin, and Cynthia were the other top executives present at the headquarters during the investigation.
4. Bob, who had just returned from a trip to Japan, showed evidence of his flight itinerary, proving he was not present during the time of the crime.
5. Kristin had an alibi, as she taught a yoga class from 5:00 pm to 7:00 pm.
6. Cynthia arrived at the office at 4:45 pm but claimed that she was there to pick up skin cream, as she liked to carry it with her.
7. No other employees were mentioned, leaving Cynthia as the only possible suspect who had access to the security tapes.
8. Despite her denial, the evidence points to Cynthia manipulating the security video, erasing the footage and turning it off to conceal her actions.
9. This suggests that Cynthia stole the secret formula for Wonder Cream with the intention of selling it to the company's competition.

Therefore, Cynthia Hogarth is the most likely culprit in the theft of the secret formula.

_____________________________________________________________ask - 14.3s, 0.2min

Based on the information provided in the story, we can deduce the following:

- Karen informed the children that she had placed a golden Easter egg in their hunting area, behind the largest tree in the field.
- Cole seemed focused on the evergreen shrubbery in the middle of the field and found several eggs there.
- Rachel mentioned finding a lot of eggs and said she was heading back to the rock pile, thinking the golden egg might be there.
- Karla warned Karen about the dead branches on the big oak tree and how one had fallen and hit one of the older kids.
- Anna was upset because she had only found a few eggs and stayed close to Karla for the remainder of the hunt.
- Justin stayed in the far right corner of the field throughout the entire hunt, where there was a sand pit and he found several eggs.
- When Karen asked if any of the children had moved from one side of the field to another while she was inside, Karla answered no.

Now, let's analyze the clues to determine the culprit:

1. Cole seems focused on the evergreen shrubbery, but there is no evidence connecting him directly to the golden egg.
2. Rachel runs to the rock pile, thinking the golden egg might be there, but again, there is no direct evidence implicating her.
3. Karla warns Karen about the dead branches on the big oak tree, but this information does not necessarily link to the golden egg.
4. Anna is upset and sticks close to Karla, but being upset or close to someone does not imply guilt.
5. Justin stays in the far right corner of the field, discovers several eggs in the sand pit, and does not move from that spot during the hunt.
6. When Karen asks if any of the children moved from one side of the field to another, Karla answers no, suggesting that no one had moved from their initial location, except for Karen herself.

Based on these clues, the most likely culprit is Justin. He stayed in the same spot throughout the entire hunt, finding several eggs. Since no one moved from their initial location, and the golden egg was placed behind the largest tree in the field, it is reasonable to suspect that Justin found the golden egg.

To determine where Barney is, we need to analyze the clues provided in the story. First, we have the potential destinations: Philadelphia (94 miles), Boston (216 miles), Washington DC (229 miles), Pittsburgh (339 miles), and Raleigh (511 miles).

Barney looks out of the left side of the train and sees suburbia, which doesn't provide any specific clues about the location. He then looks out of the right side and sees greenery and a park with a small statue. This park and statue could be significant in identifying the location.

Barney also finds his juggling balls, which he associates with problem-solving. This suggests that the location can be determined with some logical reasoning.

Based on the information given, we can make the following deductions:
1. The train left New York City at 3:00 am and will arrive at its destination at 10:00 am.
2. Barney has until 10:00 am to determine his location and call the correct phone number.
3. Barney sees a park with a small statue, which could be a notable landmark.
4. The distances provided for each potential destination can be used to narrow down the possibilities.

To solve the mystery, we need to determine the location based on the clues given.

From the distances provided:
- Philadelphia, PA (94 miles) seems to be too close, considering the time the train has been traveling.
- Boston, MA (216 miles) and Washington, DC (229 miles) are also relatively close, but still within the realm of possibility.
- Pittsburgh, PA (339 miles) seems more plausible, as it is a greater distance from New York City.
- Raleigh, NC (511 miles) is the farthest potential destination and may not be the correct answer based on the distances traveled.

Considering the park with the small statue as a significant clue, we would need more information to identify the specific location accurately. However, based on the distances and deductive reasoning, Pittsburgh, PA seems like the most likely answer.

Therefore, the culprit who orchestrated this prank is Barney's good friend Fred.

Based on the information provided in the story, we can deduce the following:

1. The spy is disguised as a chef in the restaurant.
2. Uncle Robert has been sent to the restaurant to intercept the microchip from the spy.
3. Uncle Robert had to figure out which dish to order in order to identify the contact spy.
4. He found an old bus ticket, a locker key, and a card thanking the bearer for donating to a vegetarian charity in the spy's wallet.

Now let's examine the clues given about each chef:

1. Gianni Girodano is making Italian-style vegetable lasagna. He flirts with female customers and serves lasagna in blue dishes, with one in a red dish.
2. Atsushi Nishi is preparing Japanese yakisoba noodles. He is described as a showman and has cooked in six different restaurants on the same day.
3. Jean-Pierre Dubois is making French onion soup, which is recommended by the waiter as popular.
4. Jack McDonald has prepared traditional haggis and trimmings.

By analyzing these clues, we can eliminate some possibilities:

- The spy is unlikely to be Gianni Girodano, as he is described as flirting with customers instead of focusing on his role as a contact spy.
- Atsushi Nishi is also an unlikely candidate, as he is busy touring different restaurants throughout the day and is not mentioned to have any unusual behavior or characteristics.
- Jack McDonald is not mentioned to have any distinctive features or clues associated with him.

This leaves us with Jean-Pierre Dubois, who is preparing French onion soup. The waiter describes it as popular, and the restaurant had an additional session for the chef to make more of the soup. Additionally, the spy's wallet contains a card thanking the bearer for donating to a vegetarian charity called Vegetarian Way. It is possible that the spy intentionally left this clue to indicate that Uncle Robert should order a vegetarian dish.

The culprit is Captain Roberts. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Captain Roberts was the last person to see the necklace before it was stolen.
2. He mentioned that the thief tried to buy their freedom with the stolen jewels, indicating that he knows the motive behind the theft.
3. Captain Roberts also mentioned that he had to go back to the cabin to fetch Will and prevent him from being left behind.
4. The white powder on the floor near the casket was caused by Will knocking it over.
5. The parrot's song, "Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum," was a clue that implicates Captain Roberts. The phrase is commonly associated with pirates, and since the parrot was in the cabin, it likely heard the captain say it.
6. Considering all the evidence, Captain Roberts most likely stole the necklace himself, used the powder and boot prints to divert suspicion, and then blamed Will.

Therefore, Captain Roberts is the culprit.

Based on the information provided, there are several potential suspects:

1. Lt. Erikson: She is the one who ordered the spare SSCU and was on duty when the sabotage occurred. However, it is mentioned that she missed the initial alert when the SSCU was disabled, which could be seen as suspicious.

2. Valance and Bennington: Both of them have the capability to remove the SSCU without setting off alarms, and they have each other's alibis. They were also working in corridor B32 during the time of the sabotage. Additionally, Bennington has a reputation as a ladies' man, which could make him a potential suspect.

3. Master Sgt. O'Hennessey: Although he has a history of misconduct, there is no direct evidence linking him to the sabotage.

4. Scrivine: The Villiasoo trader had access to the military sector and interacted with some of the crew members, including Valance. It is mentioned that the Villiasoo are allegedly more "neutral" towards the Ravshek, which raises suspicion.

Based on the new evidence:

1. The security sergeant visiting O'Hennessey in the brig implies that O'Hennessey is not involved in the sabotage. He confidently asserts that the true culprit will be found under the investigation led by "Sherlock," referring to Lt. Commander Cecelia Holman.

2. The handprints of insulation foam on Lt. Erikson's uniform suggest that Bennington, who has insulation smears on his hands, may have come into contact with her.

3. The discovery of two brand new lighting controllers hidden in the insulation of corridor B32 indicates that something unusual was happening in that area.

From the available information, it can be concluded that Bennington is the most likely culprit. His technical ability, reputation as a ladies' man, presence in corridor B32 during the sabotage, and his potential connection to Lt. Erikson make him the prime suspect.

1. Zach and Larry saw a flying saucer in the desert, which turned out to be a practical joke set up in advance. This suggests that someone deliberately created the illusion of a spaceship.

2. Uncle Art received a strange letter postmarked from Santa Fe, supposedly from a TV station, asking to discuss the "flying starcraft" seen. However, Larry points out that the letter is not on letterhead, and a TV station would typically call rather than write a letter about news. This suggests that the letter may be a fabrication.

6. Tom went in to look at the necklace and helped Christopher count the bank deposit.
7. Christopher asked Tom to put the necklace away, and Tom locked the front door behind Christopher and Robert.
8. Tom went to his favorite chair in the lunchroom where the outside camera monitor is kept. Every hour, he made a lap around the store.

10. Earl arrived at 1:30 a.m., scanned Tom through the x-ray machine, and Tom went home.
11. Earl checked on the empty cabinet where the pearl necklace was kept and had the same story as Tom.
12. Christopher checked on the necklace, counted the money with Tom's help, and left for the day after Tom scanned Robert and the deposit through the x-ray machine.
13. Robert arrived, met Christopher in the office, briefly looked at the necklace, and left to collect deposits on his route.
14. The x-ray scanner showed no signs of anyone taking the pearls, and the security video from the night of the robbery didn't provide any clues.

This leaves us with Sgt. Crosby and Sgt. Thornton as the remaining suspects. 

Crosby claims to have found Bryan dead upon his return to the tent and was with various friends on the other side of the camp throughout the night. 

Thornton claims to have been outside walking for most of the night and only came back to the tent a couple of times when he heard Horner snoring. 

Considering the evidence and alibis, the likely culprit is Sgt. Thornton. His statement that nobody saw him walking at night creates some doubt and raises suspicion. Additionally, the fact that he only returned to the tent when he heard Horner snoring could suggest that he was trying to create an alibi. 

Therefore, Sgt. Thornton is the likely killer in this mystery story.

The culprit who stole the cannon is Captain Parker. 

Step 1: Consider the details of the crime. The cannon was stolen from the loading dock, where it was shipped topside. It was a long-range cannon that would require several dockworkers using block and tackle to remove it. The theft occurred at night during high tide, yet nobody noticed anything unusual, including the guards who were patrolling the area.

Step 2: Review the suspects. The suspects involved are Captain Parker (the ship captain), Bob Turkle (blacksmith), Tom Wise (fishmonger), and Paul Rhodes (baker). Captain Parker had been in and out of the harbor multiple times and had been responsible for delivering the cannon. Bob Turkle had interacted with Captain Parker and had a load of pig iron coming with the cannon. Tom Wise and Paul Rhodes were loyalists who had made threats against the ship.

Step 3: Examine the alibis. Captain Parker claimed that he had been aboard the ship all night and heard nothing. Bob Turkle stated that Captain Parker often delivered his iron and gave him a discount this time because of the cannon delivery. Tom Wise and Paul Rhodes proclaimed their loyalty to the king but denied stealing the cannon.

Step 4: Analyze the clues. The cannon's weight and size made it difficult to remove without anyone noticing or hearing something. The guards did not see any unusual activities during their patrol. The derricks hanging over the water were not rigged. The ship appeared empty except for a stack of iron covered with an oil-impregnated cloth.

Step 5: The crucial clue. Peter noticed roman numerals on the side of the ship indicating the ship's depth in the water. When Peter's father, John Webster, returned from his office after studying the enigma, he realized that the ship was still as deep in the water as it was the day before. This realization led John Webster to announce that he knew where the cannon was and who took it.

Step 6: Conclusion. Based on the information and the crucial clue, it can be deduced that Captain Parker took the cannon. The fact that the ship remained at the same depth in the water suggests that the cannon was not unloaded or removed from the ship. Since Captain Parker was responsible for delivering the cannon, he would have had the opportunity and knowledge to keep it hidden on the ship. This, combined with his assertive attitude and lack of concern during the investigation, points to his guilt as the culprit who stole the cannon.

2. The onlooker informs Diane that Tom has kitchen duty, meaning he has to be at the dining hall by 5:00 a.m., which rules him out as a suspect.

4. One of the campers explains that Cindy had severe leg cramps after a long hike led by Danny, and Allie tried to alleviate the cramps.

Based on this information, Diane can conclude that Danny is the only counselor who could have rigged the buckets of water.

To determine the spy's identity, we can analyze the information provided:

1. The sergeant suspects that one of the soldiers is a spy who planted the dynamite on the bridge.
2. He knows that there is no one else near the bridge for miles, making it unlikely that an outsider could have approached without being seen.
3. Each soldier arrived during the week, claiming to have been sent by their regiment's office.
4. The sergeant mentions that each soldier arrived carrying a backpack, which could have concealed the dynamite.
5. The sergeant asks a question to test if one of the soldiers displays ignorance or allegiance to the Confederacy. This question eliminates suspicion from Winslow, as he correctly answers that Abraham Lincoln is the President of the United States.
6. The sergeant asks who arrived first, and the soldiers answer in the following order: Parker, McMurty, Winslow, and Garret.
7. The soldiers mention where they were sleeping: Garrett under a tree, Winslow in front of a bush, McMurty beside the campfire, and Parker behind a rock.
8. The soldiers mention the states they were sent from: Garrett from Ohio, Parker from West Virginia, Winslow from Indiana, and McMurty from Illinois.

Based on this information, we can deduce the following:

1. Since the spy planted the dynamite on the bridge, they had the opportunity to do so before the soldiers arrived during the week.
2. The spy would need to arrive early to carry out the sabotage unnoticed.
3. Based on the soldiers' arrival order, Parker is the only soldier who arrived first.
4. Garrett's excuse for arriving later due to a lazy horse could be a lie to cover up his early arrival.
5. Winslow's suspicious behavior and responses indicate that he could be the spy.

1. Johnny claims that someone stole his flute, which implies that it was taken by one of the other students on the bus.
2. Ed Tuttle, the bus driver, notices that nobody stood up or crossed the aisle after the five students boarded the bus at the last stop.
3. Ed deduces that the person who took the flute must have been sitting directly in front of or behind Johnny.
4. Chloe and Susan were sitting in front of Johnny, and Lyle was sitting behind him.
5. Johnny accuses Lyle of potentially taking the flute, but Lyle does not have a motive and does not show any signs of guilt or suspicious behavior.
6. Johnny suggests searching the suspects, but Ed mentions that he does not have the authority to conduct a search.
7. The school bell rings, indicating the start of classes.
8. Ed suddenly realizes that he knows who took the flute, implying that he has deduced the culprit based on the available information.
9. The only person left as a potential suspect is Marty Nolan, Johnny's older brother.
10. Marty had a hockey bag with equipment, which could easily conceal the flute.
11. Marty jokes about needing his hockey helmet "in case things get too rough," potentially hinting at his involvement in the theft.

Based on the clues provided, it can be inferred that Mrs. Roberts, Randy Peters, Mr. Carlson, and Mr. Leamington are the potential suspects.

First, Mrs. Roberts seems to be upset with the progress of her weight loss and blames the psychologist for it. However, there is no direct evidence linking her to the slashing of the tires.

Next, Randy Peters mentions having dreams where a person resembling the psychologist chases him. While this could be seen as a clue, there is no direct evidence linking Peters to the crime either.

Mr. Carlson mentions being upset and wanting to take his frustration out on someone because of his phobia. However, there is no direct evidence suggesting that he acted upon this frustration by slashing the tires.

Based on the given information, let's analyze the potential motives and evidence against each suspect:

1. Grieve Collier: He had a past dispute with Red Tembeck and was shown the gold horde in the root cellar. However, there is no evidence linking him directly to the murder or theft.

2. Bryan Durell: He recently moved to town and had financial troubles. He heard rumors about Tembeck's gold but claims to have no knowledge of its location. Again, there is no concrete evidence against him.

3. Jacques Bourbonne: He had a heated argument with Tembeck and blamed him for a chainsaw accident. While his temper and animosity towards Tembeck are evident, there is no evidence tying him to the murder or theft.

4. Ruth Majick: She was Red Tembeck's ex-wife and facing foreclosure on her cafe. She knows about the gold coins and desperately needs money. However, her crutch suggests she has been dealing with lumbago and may not be physically capable of committing the murder herself.

Based on the available information and evidence, it appears that Ruth Majick is the least likely suspect. Her physical condition and lack of direct evidence against her make it unlikely for her to be the murderer. 

Therefore, the most likely culprit is Jacques Bourbonne. His violent temper, argument with Tembeck, and close proximity to the crime scene make him a strong suspect. Further investigation may be required to gather additional evidence.

Based on the information provided in the story, the prime suspect for stealing Tro's mechanical pencil is Steve Clairborne.

1. Steve had access to the key to the audit room, which means he had the means to enter and potentially take the pencil without anyone noticing.
2. When Tro mentioned that his pencil was missing, Steve immediately went back to the audit room to investigate, suggesting that he may have suspected something.
3. Steve had a prior interest in Tro's expensive mechanical pencil, as indicated by Shel's comment and Tro's response. This implies that he may have had a motive to steal it.

Based on the information provided in the story, we can determine the culprit by analyzing the actions and statements of the characters.

1. The five monsters (the witch, the vampire, the werewolf, the mummy, and the ghost) approached the cemetery gates hesitantly but eventually decided to enter to prove their bravery.

2. Linda, the witch, suggested that they were separating the grown-ups from the children, indicating that she wanted to prove herself and be seen as equal to the others.

3. Randy, the werewolf, mentioned that the real monsters come out to play on Halloween night and that they were wearing costumes to blend in and pretend to be monsters themselves.

4. Donald, the vampire, mentioned that vampires could crawl out of man-sized holes in graves.

5. Inside the crypt, after the door closed and they were in total darkness, Linda could not find her flashlight.

6. Randy spilled his candy, causing a commotion as he picked it up, and during this time, a sound of rocks scraping against each other was heard.

7. When Linda turned on her flashlight, they noticed a hole in the crypt wall where two large concrete bricks had been pulled out. Donald attempted to go through the hole but realized he couldn't fit.

8. Wendell, the mummy, managed to leave the crypt and screamed before coming back to open the front door, claiming to have seen zombies.

9. When they ran outside, they witnessed zombies breaking out of the graves.

10. The protagonist, the ghost, deduced that the zombies were fake as one did not move when they pulled it out of the ground, revealing it to be foam-filled latex.

Considering all of this information, we can conclude that Randy, the werewolf, is the most likely culprit. Here's the reasoning:

1. Randy had inside knowledge about Halloween night and the presence of real monsters.

2. Randy spilled his candy, causing a distraction during which the crypt door closed and the sound of rocks scraping against each other was heard.

3. Randy mentioned that their costumes would make them look horrifying, possibly scaring any real monsters away.

4. Randy was the first to mention the possibility of zombies while being chased, indicating prior knowledge or involvement.

While the story does not explicitly state Randy as the culprit, his actions, statements, and knowledge suggest that he is responsible for setting up the fake zombies to scare the others.
The suspects are Donald,Linda,Randy,Wendell
gen("\nBased on the information provided in the story, we can determine the culprit by analyzing the actions and statements of the characters.\n\n1. The five monsters (the witch, the vampire, the werewolf, the mummy, and the ghost) approached the cemetery gates hesitantly but eventually decided to enter to prove their bravery.\n\n2. Linda, the witch, suggested that they were separating the grown-ups from the children, indicating that she wanted to prove herself and be seen as equal to the others.\n\n3. Randy, the werewolf, mentioned that the real monsters come out to play on Halloween night and that they were wearing costumes to blend in and pretend to be monsters themselves.\n\n4. Donald, the vampire, mentioned that vampires could crawl out of man-sized holes in graves.\n\n5. Inside the crypt, after the door closed and they were in total darkness, Linda could not find her flashlight.\n\n6. Randy spilled his candy, causing a commotion as he picked it up, and during this time, a sound of rocks scraping against each other was heard.\n\n7. When Linda turned on her flashlight, they noticed a hole in the crypt wall where two large concrete bricks had been pulled out. Donald attempted to go through the hole but realized he couldn't fit.\n\n8. Wendell, the mummy, managed to leave the crypt and screamed before coming back to open the front door, claiming to have seen zombies.\n\n9. When they ran outside, they witnessed zombies breaking out of the graves.\n\n10. The protagonist, the ghost, deduced that the zombies were fake as one did not move when they pulled it out of the ground, revealing it to be foam-filled latex.\n\nConsidering all of this information, we can conclude that Randy, the werewolf, is the most likely culprit. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. Randy had inside knowledge about Halloween night and the presence of real monsters.\n\n2. Randy spilled his candy, causing a distraction during which the crypt door closed and the sound of rocks scraping against each other was heard.\n\n3. Randy mentioned that their costumes would make them look horrifying, possibly scaring any real monsters away.\n\n4. Randy was the first to mention the possibility of zombies while being chased, indicating prior knowledge or involvement.\n\nWhile the story does not explicitly state Randy as the culprit, his actions, statements, and knowledge suggest that he is responsible for setting up the fake zombies to scare the others.\nSo as explained, the culprit is", ['Donald', 'Linda', 'Randy', 'Wendell'])

2. When Jesse went to retrieve the chessboard, he discovered that all 16 pawns were missing.
3. The referee accused Gordon of stealing the chess pieces, suggesting that it is possible for him to have sneaked in there without being noticed.

Based on the information provided, the murderer is Gene Roberts. 

Reasoning: 

1. Leon greeted Ed Puckett as the first customer in the men’s area. Ed went to the fitting room to try on suits. At 10:25, Leon spotted Gene Roberts browsing the edge of the men’s area just after Ed had left the dressing room. 

2. Leon greeted Gene and led him to the dress shirt table, while Louis Murphy was still trying on the sport coat and slacks in the fitting room. 

3. Leon then helped Justin Tanner find the men’s sweaters and walked him to the sweater table. Justin expressed his intention to try on a sweater in the fitting room. 

4. When Leon went to check on Louis at 10:45, he saw Justin entering the fitting room with a green sweater. 

Based on this sequence of events, Gene Roberts is the murderer. He was the only customer who had the opportunity to commit the crime. At 10:50, George Whitley approached Leon from the shoe department, and Leon was occupied with placing an order for George until after 11:00. During this time, Gene was the only customer left in the men's department. 

Additionally, it is mentioned that Gene left without trying anything on, which is abnormal behavior for a customer. This could indicate that he had ulterior motives or was trying to avoid drawing attention to himself.

1. Livvie, Katie's three-year-old daughter, went with Katie and Alicia to the gum counter. She did not have the opportunity to steal the snack.

2. Emilee, Katie's nine-year-old daughter, was tempted by Mr. Darby to have a sample of hard candy, but she resisted and did not steal the snack.

3. Brianna, Alicia's two-year-old daughter, was distracted by the brownies and cookies section. Although she smudged the glass with her fingers, she did not have the means to steal the snack.

4. Trevor, Alicia's six-year-old son, was found in the licorice section, which was odd considering he had recently lost a tooth. This suggests that he may have been trying to find a soft snack that he could eat without chewing.

5. Justin, Alicia's four-year-old son, was found in the messy soft chocolate section, but the candy there was placed out of reach for small children. He did not have the opportunity to steal the snack.

Based on the information provided, let's analyze the suspects and their potential motives:

1. Tor Hansen: Tor claimed he didn't want birdseed because he had sunflowers and did not appreciate birds being brought into the neighborhood. However, he knew that the missing sack of birdseed was a fifty-pound bag, even though Hal had not mentioned the weight. This shows that Tor had knowledge of the specific bag, indicating he may be the culprit.

2. Billy Mumms: Billy denied seeing anyone carrying a bag of birdseed but had purple martins nesting in his birdhouses. While purple martins primarily eat mosquitoes and insects, it is possible that some birds could have consumed the birdseed, making him a potential suspect.

3. Cheryl Judson: Cheryl stated that she doesn't have a need for birdseed and does not encourage birds or waterfowl due to their noise. However, the mama duck and baby ducks swam towards Hal, indicating a potential interest in food. While not a direct suspect, Cheryl cannot be ruled out entirely.

4. Stan Mifflin: Stan claimed to be building an aviary for exotic birds and did not mention a need for birdseed. However, one of his scarlet macaws spoke and emphasized that it only ate nuts and fresh fruit. This indicates that Stan's birds do not consume seeds, making him less likely to be the culprit.

Considering the information gathered, Tor Hansen emerges as the prime suspect. He showed knowledge about the weight of the missing bag of birdseed, which was not shared with him. Additionally, Tor has shown hostility towards birds and did not have any other plausible reason to know about the bag of birdseed.

Based on the information provided, the possible culprits for putting Roger's hat in the monkey cage are Leonard, Tom, Cindy, and Henry. Let's analyze the clues to narrow down the list of suspects:

1. Leonard has a history of practical jokes, but it is mentioned that he never repeats the same practical joke twice. Additionally, he had no access to Roger's hat on this occasion, as it was left on top of the fridge.

2. Tom seems eager to finish the tour quickly because he has a baseball game at 4 PM. Though he is dismissive of the animals and doesn't appear to have a good relationship with them, there is no direct evidence linking him to the hat incident.

3. Cindy is portrayed as a kind-hearted person who engages with the animals and has knowledge about them. She even mentions the intelligence of cockatoos and the mourning behavior of elephants. There is no indication that she has any motive to play a prank or access to Roger's hat.

4. Henry is shown to be nervous and fearful of being yelled at. He drops the cantaloupe while helping Roger with the elephant's food, which leads to him worrying about being scolded. However, he successfully retrieves the plate of food for the chimpanzees without any mishap. There is no evidence suggesting that he played the prank or had access to the hat.

Given the available information, the most likely culprit is Leonard. Although he didn't have access to the hat directly, his history of practical jokes makes him the primary suspect. The fact that Roger and the students find the situation amusing also suggests that the culprit is someone they know and are comfortable with, further implicating Leonard.

1. Motive: Elmer and Katherine Tydings disagreed with selling the bible, as opposed to John and Louise Stubbs who favored it. This suggests that they had a motive to steal the bible in order to prevent its sale.

2. Opportunity: Elmer Tydings was seen grabbing the bible during the argument at the church meeting, and he claims to have later returned it that night. Katherine Tydings corroborates his story and there is a witness who saw her walking from her car to the church. This provides them with the opportunity to steal and return the bible.

Based on the information provided in the story, the most likely culprit who stole the necklace is Fiona Duncan. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Eleanor Williams was the owner of the necklace and the host of the cocktail party.
2. Eleanor initially left the necklace on her bed and became distracted by a wrong number phone call.
3. Fiona Duncan arrived first to the party, wearing a simple and relatively inexpensive evening dress. She also wore high heel shoes with pointy heels that Eleanor detested.
4. Eleanor took Fiona's jacket and purse to the closet, where she could see the necklace on the bed from the restroom and hall closet.
5. Colonel Barrow arrived next, and Eleanor took his coat and put it in the same closet with Fiona's jacket.
6. Abby Grant arrived last and was served a drink by Eleanor. She was wearing her own diamond necklace, not Eleanor's missing one.
7. The group sat in the living room with Eleanor facing the kitchen and the hallway behind her.
8. During the cocktail period, Colonel Barrow and Fiona Duncan both separately excused themselves to go to the hall restroom, which was next to the closet where the necklace was visible. Fiona went shortly after Colonel Barrow.
9. Harold briefly excused himself to retrieve ice from the kitchen. When he returned, Eleanor invited everyone into the hallway to view a new painting.
10. Abby briefly excused herself to suppress a sneezing fit, but it is not stated where she went.
11. Dinner was served by Maurice Eades, the family caterer and friend.
12. Eleanor noticed at dinner that Abby was wearing her own diamond necklace, but she did not retrieve her own necklace from the bedroom.
13. After the party ended, Eleanor returned to her bedroom and found her diamond necklace missing.
14. Based on the timeline and the opportunity, Fiona Duncan is the most likely culprit. She was the only person who had an opportunity to take the necklace when she went to the hall restroom after Colonel Barrow.

Therefore, Fiona Duncan is the most likely culprit who stole the necklace.

Based on the information given, it is implied that one of the four ghosts (John Adams, Andrew Jackson, William Howard Taft, or Calvin Coolidge) left the gift for the White House children. 
To determine the culprit, we can analyze the clues provided:
1. The gift consists of a White House ornament with a scene of the nation's capital and the view from the Hay-Adams Hotel.
2. The ornament opens to reveal another scene of the Statue of Liberty with American flags and a ship with soldiers.
3. The previous president had received a similar gift eight years ago, indicating a tradition of leaving ornaments for the children.
4. The gift is signed by all four ghosts: John Adams, Andrew Jackson, William Howard Taft, and Calvin Coolidge.

Based on these clues, it can be deduced that the culprit who left the gift is Calvin Coolidge. The mention of the Hay-Adams Hotel suggests a connection to Coolidge, who was associated with the hotel during his presidency. Additionally, Coolidge is the only one among the four ghosts who had a reputation for not saying much, which aligns with the fact that he did not actively participate in the conversation about the gift.

Therefore, Calvin Coolidge is the likely culprit who left the gift for the White House children.

Based on the information given, there are several potential culprits. Let's go through the observations:

Tuesday:
- Peter entered the vault with a client, carrying a vanilla folder containing papers. He only had the firm's key to the lockbox.
- The client's lockbox was not visible from the doorway and Robert's view.

Wednesday:
- Edward entered the vault with a big duffel bag. Upon leaving, he only had a pencil in his hand.

Thursday:
- James entered the vault with a client. Robert's attention was briefly diverted by a phone call, so he missed the moment they exited.

- Russell entered the vault with his administrative assistant, Jane. He had his suit coat on and carried a briefcase. Peter interrupted their conversation.

- Ronald visited the vault alone later in the day, staying inside a long time and exiting a few minutes after closing time.

Based on these observations, the culprit who placed an item in the lockbox can be deduced as follows:

1. Edward can be eliminated as a suspect because he carried a duffel bag into the vault, which would be too large to fit into lockbox 100.

2. Similarly, James can also be eliminated as a suspect because Robert's attention was diverted, so he didn't see them exit the vault. Their presence in the vault alone does not provide enough evidence.

3. Ronald's lengthy stay in the vault raises suspicion, but it is not conclusive evidence unless Robert asks him what he was doing inside.

4. Peter entered the vault with a client, but Robert couldn't see their lockbox, so it's unclear if they placed an item inside lockbox 100.

This leaves us with Russell, who entered the vault with his administrative assistant, Jane. Additionally, Peter interrupted their conversation, possibly providing a distraction for Russell to place the item in lockbox 100 unnoticed.

Therefore, based on the given information, Russell is the most likely culprit who placed an item in lockbox 100.

Based on the entries in the journals, it can be deduced that each family member has a different story about where the hidden treasure is located. To determine which journal contains the truth, we need to analyze the information provided in each entry:

1. Wilbur Cross: He claims to have stolen gold from a Union payroll train in Elmira, New York and buried it six feet under a flat tombstone in the back pasture of the Cross family homestead.

2. Susie Cross: She states that Wilbur stole the gold spike when working on the transcontinental railroad and hid it in a false floor in the upper loft of the round barn.

3. Leonard Cross: He mentions a chest of silver nuggets that Wilbur accepted as payment for a large parcel of land. Leonard moved it to a new hiding place in the basement closet behind a false wall.

4. Victor Cross: He suggests that Wilbur hid valuable stocks and bonds behind the icebox in the kitchen, as he did not trust banks.

5. Edith Cross: She reveals that Wilbur hid a box full of 100 and 500 dollar bills from the 1880s under the southeast corner floorboards in the old washroom.

Analyzing the information, we can eliminate Susie's and Victor's entries as they contradict each other. If the gold spike was hidden in the round barn, there would be no reason for Victor to mention valuable stocks and bonds hidden in the kitchen.

Additionally, Leonard's entry about the chest of silver nuggets does not align with Edith's entry about the 100 and 500 dollar bills. If Wilbur had accepted silver nuggets as payment, it is unlikely that he would also have a box full of bills.

This leaves us with Wilbur's and Edith's entries. Both mention something that Wilbur stole, but Edith's entry suggests that Wilbur was a crook himself. Considering that Wilbur was a Civil War veteran who served with distinction in the Union Army, it is unlikely that he would have engaged in criminal activities.

Therefore, the journal containing the truth is Wilbur Cross's entry, where he mentions the gold buried six feet under a flat tombstone in the back pasture of the Cross family homestead.

If Wilbur had accepted silver nuggets as payment, it is unlikely that he would also have a box full of bills.\n\nThis leaves us with Wilbur's and Edith's entries. Both mention something that Wilbur stole, but Edith's entry suggests that Wilbur was a crook himself. Considering that Wilbur was a Civil War veteran who served with distinction in the Union Army, it is unlikely that he would have engaged in criminal activities.\n\nTherefore, the journal containing the truth is Wilbur Cross's entry, where he mentions the gold buried six feet under a flat tombstone in the back pasture of the Cross family homestead.\nSo as explained, the culprit is", ['Journal entry of Edith', 'Journal entry of Leonard', 'Journal entry of Susie', 'Journal entry of Victor', 'Journal entry of Wilbur'])
The culprit is Journal entry of Wilbur.

In fact, it is Journal entry of Leonard.

1. Melchoir is described as wearing funny-looking slippers that were still wet from the snow. This indicates that he was recently outside and likely near the garage door where the kitten was found.

2. The tracks leading from the parking circle to the outside garage door were only visible after Melchoir arrived and before no tracks were seen an hour before. This suggests that Melchoir had recently been near the garage door.

3. Melchoir asks how they will know it's their cat and provides a specific description of the kitten they saw at the Humane Society. This indicates that he is aware of the cat's appearance because he was the one who delivered it.

4. When Melchoir asks about identifying the cat, Dad suddenly gasps for breath and takes out an inhaler because his asthma acts up in the cold weather. This suggests that Melchoir's recent presence in the cold weather triggered Dad's asthma symptoms, reinforcing the idea that Melchoir was near the open, cold garage door.

Based on the information provided, it is highly likely that Tom Jenks is the culprit. Here are the reasons why:

1. David Loftkiss: Though he matches the general description of the Flying Bandit, his fear of flying and preference for taking an ocean liner instead of a plane makes it unlikely that he is the culprit. Additionally, his urgent business in New York could be a legitimate reason for his attempted travel.

2. Cliff Snelling: While he strongly resembles the Flying Bandit, his intention to board a ferry at Holyhead to go to Dublin for a painting commission at Lord Harding's Irish estate does not align with the Flying Bandit's suspected motive of retracing his original flight path.

3. Tom Jenks: He matches the general description of the Flying Bandit, was picked up at Heathrow Airport, which is more in line with the flight path from Liverpool, and had an intended destination of Gander, Newfoundland, which is consistent with the Bandit's potential route. Additionally, his aggressive reaction and false arrest claim suggest that he might be trying to divert attention from his involvement in the crime.

4. Clem Duster: While he rented a plane and had a flight plan to Iceland, his explanation of wanting to visit hot springs due to a skin condition seems like a more innocent reason compared to the others. Furthermore, there is no mention of him fitting the description of the Flying Bandit.

Based on the information provided, Tom Jenks is the most likely suspect.

Based on the information provided, the culprit who forged the engagement is Wallace Anders.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Sheila Ingalls, the daughter of Reverend Martin Ingalls, was expecting the announcement of her engagement to Wallace Anders. However, when she arrived at the church, she discovered that Wallace Anders was listed as engaged to Georgette Pelham instead.

2. Reverend Ingalls confirmed that he, as the sole person responsible for making and posting the announcements, noticed the mistake and locked it behind glass. He mentioned that he has a duplicate key at home, while the key he waggled was the only one possessed by him.

3. Reverend Ingalls mentioned that Wallace Anders came to the parish office and asked to post the engagement announcement the previous night. Reverend Ingalls, who has poor eyesight, only glanced at the notice before hanging it on the board.

4. Georgette Pelham also came to see the announcement and seemed happy, according to Reverend Ingalls. It was known in the town that she wanted to marry Wallace Anders.

5. Sheila Ingalls stated that she and Wallace Anders had a conversation about getting engaged a week ago, and he agreed to post the announcement. However, she discovered a forgery instead.

Based on this information, it can be concluded that Wallace Anders forged the engagement announcement. He had the opportunity since he visited the parish office to post the announcement, as confirmed by Reverend Ingalls. Furthermore, Georgette Pelham's presence at the church after Wallace was there suggests that she may have been involved or aware of the forgery, but her emotional state, being happy, contradicts her involvement in the forgery.

Therefore, the most likely culprit who forged the engagement announcement is Wallace Anders.

Based on the information provided in the story, we can deduce the following:

1. Marie had a strict rule that the glassine ornament should not be touched.
2. Marie noticed that the glass house ornament was missing after the gifts were unwrapped and everyone was sitting down.
3. None of the adults had been near the tree since returning home from the restaurant, so the culprit must be one of the grandchildren.
4. Marie expressed that she had a pretty good idea of who took it.

To determine the culprit, we can analyze the actions and characteristics of each grandchild:

1. Lennie: He is described as slender and tall, and he received the first gift from Mike. There is no indication of any suspicious behavior from him, and his physical characteristics don't match the description of the culprit.

2. Crosby: At 19 years old, he is considered the most mature among the grandchildren. He receives his first gift from Mike while sitting in a chair and doesn't move from there during the unwrapping of gifts. There is no indication of any suspicious behavior from him, and his age and demeanor make it unlikely that he is the culprit.

3. Sandy: Sandy is a 9-year-old girl who receives gifts from Mike and passes Jackie's gifts to her. There is no indication of any suspicious behavior from her.

4. Jackie: Jackie is an 8-year-old girl who doesn't feel well and sits with her mother, Aunt Pat, and her infant brother, George, the entire night. There is no indication of any suspicious behavior from her either.

5. Tommy: Tommy is a 10-year-old boy, Crosby's younger brother. He grabs his first gift from Mike's hand and realizes his mistake, quickly apologizing. This indicates that he may not always think before acting, but there is no further indication that he took the glass house ornament.

6. Mike: Mike is a 9-year-old boy who was responsible for passing out the gifts. He is described as slightly chubby, average height, and on his knees underneath the tree. He remains in this position until all gifts are unwrapped. Mike is the only grandchild who had direct contact with the glass house ornament, as he passed it on to the other grandchildren during the gift distribution.

1. The robotic dog walked into a wall while the real dog, Jack, reacted by hiding under the table. This suggests that Jack is a real dog and not the culprit.
2. Muddy dog prints were found leading from the basement to the table where the turkey once sat. This points to the possibility that Jack might have been involved in the theft.

1. The keys on the brass keyboard were tampered with, as noticed by Steven. The smallest key (key number 1) was hung upside down, and key number 3 was hung backward.

2. Key number 2 is for the master bedroom, keys 4 and 5 are for the twins' downstairs bedrooms, and key 6 is for an upstairs bedroom.

3. Steven mentioned to one of his children about keeping something of great value in one of the kids' bedrooms. He couldn't remember the details of the conversation.

4. Steven decides to hide and wait for the mystery visitor. On the first attempt, he hears footsteps and clinking on the keyboard downstairs. The mystery visitor goes downstairs and opens a door that sounds distant. The car noise startles the visitor, who quickly leaves through the back door.

5. On the second attempt, the mystery visitor comes upstairs and opens a bedroom door, but Steven can't determine which room it is.

6. Steven finds a new silk handkerchief on the upstairs hall floor, presumably dropped by the mystery visitor.

Based on the clues provided in the story, the culprit who stole the scarecrow's mask is Mr. Kincaid, the third guest at the castle.

1. Bertram mentioned that the thief entered from outside, following footprints that led to the stairs. Mr. Kincaid is the only guest who could have wet hair from being outside in the rain.

2. When searching Mr. Kincaid's room, suits, and pockets, there was no sign of the scarecrow's mask. This suggests that he could have hidden it somewhere else.

3. The white, wet, and slimy potato peel found on the west staircase indicates that someone had been eating a potato and was likely trying to dispose of the evidence. Mr. Kincaid was seen carrying a pecan pie that he had prepared, which suggests that he had access to a kitchen and food and could have been eating a potato.

4. Mr. Kincaid's defiant and boastful attitude towards his ancestor, the sheriff, and his desire for the castle's prime exhibit to remain missing further supports his possible involvement in the theft.

Therefore, based on these clues, it can be concluded that Mr. Kincaid is the culprit who stole the scarecrow's mask.

Based on the information provided, we can deduce that the butler, Mr. Philips, is the scarecrow slasher. Here is the step-by-step analysis:

1. Four scarecrow attacks have occurred, and Mr. Forbes believes he will be the next victim.

2. Inspector Gregson notes that the damage was done with a knife, ruling out a wild animal. He suspects it could be a gang or that Mr. Forbes himself concocted the case for publicity.

3. Mr. Forbes reports seeing a figure attacking the scarecrow from his window, and he calls the police at exactly the same time that the maid, Annie, claims to have seen the slasher.

4. Annie describes the slasher as a single figure crossing the field from the house and attacking the scarecrow with a knife. The time she saw the slasher matches the time of Mr. Forbes' call to the police.

5. Inspector Gregson interviews the cook, Mrs. Avery, who mentions that she has been locking the house kitchen to prevent the butler, Mr. Philips, from taking provisions. She also reveals that she set out old clothes for the scarecrow, which are now ripped to shreds.

6. Inspector Gregson finds a glittering necklace among the spare clothes, indicating that someone has been using the scarecrow as a disguise to carry out the attacks.

7. When questioned, Mr. Philips denies any knowledge of the scarecrow slashings and claims to have been sleeping during the time of the attacks.

8. Inspector Gregson concludes that Mr. Philips is the scarecrow slasher because he had the opportunity to access the spare clothes and disguise himself as the scarecrow. His increase in appetite led Mrs. Avery to lock the kitchen, implying that he needed provisions for his nightly activities.

Based on the information provided, it can be determined that the culprit who stole the gold sculpture is Miss Pendlebury. Here is the step-by-step analysis:

1. Jealousy and treachery have plagued the Yoxley Art Prize, indicating a motive for someone to commit a dishonest act, such as stealing the gold sculpture.
2. Mr. Reese, the head judge, seems gruff and disinterested in the event. This suggests that he may not be motivated to steal the sculpture.
3. Miss Jones is criticized by Miss Pendlebury for her inappropriate attire, but this does not directly implicate her in the theft.
4. Mr. Horgan shows a keen interest in the buffet and demonstrates no knowledge of the creaking board in the viewing room. However, this does not provide definitive evidence of his involvement in the theft.
5. When Miss Pendlebury enters the viewing room after Mr. Horgan, she denies hearing the creaking board, even though Mr. Horgan mentioned it. This suggests that she may have tampered with or switched the sculpture.
6. Later, when the gold sculpture is dropped and shatters, it becomes evident that it has been switched with a different material. Since Miss Pendlebury had the opportunity to access the pieces individually, she could have easily switched the gold sculpture with a fragile substitute.

Based on the information provided, it is likely that Fastidious Fred Fielder is the culprit. 

Firstly, Moriarty states that he wants to get rid of Sherlock Holmes, and each of the four men have been tasked with forming a plan for his removal. 

Ed the Bludgeoner's plan involves waylaying Holmes in a foggy alley and attacking him with a bludgeon. While this plan may be straightforward, it does not align with Moriarty's desire for deniability and having an underling commit the crime.

Herman Houlihan's plan involves using an attractive young woman to lure Holmes and then killing him with a knife. This plan also falls short of Moriarty's preference for a more covert method, as it relies on Houlihan's ability to find the right woman and does not guarantee success.

Morris the Ascot Dandy's plan involves appealing to Holmes' vanity by inviting him for a free hat fitting and then killing him. While this plan may be clever, it does not involve a lot of subtlety or careful planning, which seems to be Moriarty's preferred approach.

Fastidious Fred Fielder, on the other hand, has observed Holmes at a concert and heard him playing the violin at 221B Baker Street. He plans to send Holmes tickets to a concert and then have an usher deliver a message during intermission, summoning Holmes to an urgent case. This plan shows a level of thoughtfulness and attention to detail that aligns with Moriarty's method of operation.

5. The detective compared the footprint found at the scene with his own boot and found that they were the same size, size 11.

6. The detective asked Frank Albertson when he sent the rotten vegetables to Mr. Fletcher, and Frank responded that it was about two months ago. This implies that the motive for Mr. Fletcher to retaliate would be weak and less likely.

7. The detective asked Bill where he went after purchasing the hunting knife, and Bill stated that he went to the grocery store and then straight home. This places him near the scene of the crime.

8. When all suspects took off one shoe, the sizes were similar except for Rachel's, whose shoe was considerably smaller.

Based on these facts and clues, the most likely culprit is Bill Albertson. The knife used to stab the scarecrow could be his lost hunting knife, and his shoe size matches the footprint found at the scene. Additionally, he had a motive due to the argument with his father.

Based on the information provided in the story, we can deduce the following:

1. Jimmy Bean's girlfriend returned a broach to Craft's Jewelry Store and received credit for it. This broach is suspected to be the missing broach from the store. The sales records show that Jane Croydon had brought in a broach, and it seemed suspicious at the time.

2. Linda's boyfriend claimed to have left her present on the counter of Mason's Department Store. When he returned, he brought a bag from the store with a bathing suit, but it was the wrong size. This implies that he might have taken an item from the on sale counter without actually purchasing it.

3. Walt found a bag containing eight unmarked DVDs in the ticket seller's booth at Acme Movie Complex. The DVDs are suspected to have been stolen from Jones Movie Rental Shop, the only movie rental shop in town. The employee who has been stealing the DVDs and removing the sleeve identification is unknown.

4. Lester's girlfriend got him a sweater that he dislikes, and she claimed to have thrown away the receipt.

Based on these clues, we can identify the culprit as follows:

- Jane Croydon is the culprit for the missing broach at Craft's Jewelry Store. She returned a broach, looked closely at the missing one, and it seemed suspicious. 

- Linda's boyfriend is the culprit for taking an item from the on sale counter at Mason's Department Store without actually purchasing it. He returned with the wrong-sized bathing suit.

Based on the information provided in the story, here is the step-by-step analysis to determine the culprit who took the painting:

1. The guests at Forest View House are Miss Lucy Smith, Daisy Morris, Dale Clark, and Iain Potts.
2. They are all beneficiaries in Mr. Peters' will.
3. Mr. Peters revealed changes to his will, stating that there is no longer a significant inheritance. This announcement upset the beneficiaries.
4. The missing painting was usually kept in the room where they had dinner.
5. Lucy Smith noticed the hanging figure of what she believed to be Mr. Peters outside and screamed. They discovered it was a first aid dummy dressed in his clothes.
6. The painting was stolen while they were outside and the dummy was taken from the house.
7. Inspector Jefferies arrived and listened to the guests' accounts of the events.
8. Mr. Peters explained that the painting was bequeathed to the local first aid school and was of significant value.
9. Lucy mentioned that she had woken up at 2 AM to take tablets and screamed upon seeing the hanging figure.
10. The guests were aware of Lucy's screams and were all present when they went to investigate.
11. They realized it was a dummy when Iain tripped over the ropes securing it.
12. Mr. Peters was the last to come downstairs and he went to the dining room to call the police.
13. Upon entering the dining room, a spaniel tied up on the far side of the table started yapping frantically until Daisy calmed him down.
14. Mr. Peters mentioned that he saw the stolen painting when he called the police and noticed it missing from the wall.
15. Inspector Jefferies, without searching the rooms, confidently declares that he knows who took the painting.

Based on the information provided, the culprit who took the painting is most likely Mr. Peters himself. He was the last to come downstairs and had the opportunity to remove the painting while everyone else was outside. Additionally, his mention of the domestic troubles with Daisy's spaniel seems like a deliberate attempt to divert attention from his actions. The fact that he noticed the missing painting before anyone else supports his involvement.

Therefore, Mr. Howard Peters is the probable culprit who took the painting.

Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine the exact culprit responsible for the disappearance of the canary. However, there are a few possible scenarios:

1. The cat Sarabelle: The cat was present in the music room when the cage fell, and it is possible that the cat could have knocked the cage off its perch, causing the door latch to open and allowing the canary to escape.

2. Alex Johnston: Alex admits to running near the house and stepping in mud, which could explain the muddy shoe outline near the French doors. He also admits to going inside to retrieve a frisbee, which may have startled the cat and caused the cage to fall. However, none of the children saw the canary escape, so it is unclear if Alex is directly responsible.

3. Jimmy Carstairs and Lydia: Both Jimmy and Lydia went inside the house to look for the frisbee at separate times. However, neither of them noticed anything about the birdcage or saw the canary escape.

2. Robert mentioned that he stayed in the kitchen all morning, watching Teresa make the Black Forest Cake and not letting her go to the bathroom until she finished.

To determine when Aubrey Behrens was in the shop, we need to analyze the information provided in the story:

1. The burglary took place between 10:10 p.m. and 5:22 a.m.

2. Ed noted that three clocks and two watches were not working that morning, and they had stopped at different times.

- The grandfather clock stopped at 10:10 p.m.
- The mantle clock stopped at 10:59 p.m.
- The office clock stopped at 2:01 a.m.
- The wristwatch stopped at 3:18 a.m.
- The pocket watch stopped at 5:22 a.m.

3. Ed mentioned that the wristwatch, which was found on the floor, was now running fine after he replaced the battery.

4. Ed also stated that the pocket watch was undamaged and was located in a display case by the front window, far from the center of the room.

Based on this information, we can gather the following:

1. The grandfather clock stopped before the mantle clock, indicating that the intrusion took place before 10:59 p.m.

2. The pocket watch, which is undamaged and was not affected by the burglar, stopped at 5:22 a.m. This implies that the burglar was still in the shop around that time.

3. The wristwatch, which was found on the floor, was not damaged and started working fine after Ed replaced the battery. This suggests that the wristwatch stopped running when the burglar knocked it over.

From the information provided, it can be concluded that Aubrey Behrens could not have been the culprit. His arrest occurred before Ed discovered the burglary, and the watches found at the crime scene do not line up with the times Behrens was present.

Therefore, the actual culprit remains unknown based on the given information.

1. The money went missing from the office safe, and only four people had access to it: Les Nolting, Sarah Kimble, Joan Carstairs, and Paul Brassard.

2. Les Nolting, the president of the company, discovered the theft when he returned from lunch. He was the last person to see the money in his safe.

3. Sarah Kimble, the secretary, cashed a company check at the bank and placed the money in Nolting's safe.

4. Joan Carstairs, the sales manager, was sharing sandwiches with Paul Brassard in the employee snack area during the lunch hour. Carstairs remembers that Brassard left the area for five minutes to answer the telephone, leaving her alone.

5. Sarah Kimble left the building to get a hot takeout lunch but returned around half an hour later, as confirmed by Paul Brassard. She had been in the office with Nolting before leaving.

6. Inspector Samuels noted that Sarah Kimble seemed to have a romantic interest in Les Nolting, but it appeared that he was unaware of it.

1. Erik saw one of his friends softly open the patio door and return to his tent. The friend had lighter shoes than the rest of his clothing. This friend remains unidentified. 

2. Erik saw a figure wearing a white pullover shirt on the patio pouring and drinking water. However, due to the darkness, he could not identify the person. 

3. Erik heard a faint rustling noise on the patio and saw a shadowy movement. This person remained hidden in the shadows for a longer time than the others.

4. Erik saw the same person, who stayed in the shadows, creeping along the fence back to his tent. 

5. Erik saw the last night-walker exit the backyard through the fence gate, only to return a few minutes later. He noticed a brief glint of a pair of eyeglasses on this person's forehead.

Based on the observations, we can conclude:

- The first unidentified friend who softly returned to his tent is not suspected of stealing the guitar since there is no evidence. 
- The person wearing a white pullover shirt on the patio cannot be identified due to the darkness.

However, Trevor is the most likely culprit for the following reasons:

- Trevor is the only friend who wears eyeglasses, which were briefly glimpsed on the last night-walker.
- Trevor is a duck hunter and is used to long periods of minimal movement and silence when stalking prey, suggesting he has the necessary discipline and patience to execute the prank.

Therefore, Trevor is the most probable culprit who stole Erik's guitar.

2. Tina, Gorg's wife: Tina is the only person besides Gorg who was present in the house when the gold record was stolen. She also showed suspicion and reluctance when Lenny asked to see where the gold record was kept.

To determine the actual culprit, we need to consider the clues provided and analyze the information given.

1. Gorg's emotional reaction: Gorg's tearful reaction upon discovering the theft could be genuine, but it could also be an act to cover up his involvement in stealing the gold record.

2. Unlocked door and the neighborhood burglar: The fact that the door was unlocked suggests the possibility of a random burglary by the neighborhood burglar. However, it also allows the suspicion to fall on Gorg or Tina since they had the opportunity to leave it unlocked intentionally.

3. Lenny's investigation technique: Lenny's interaction with Stu may have been an attempt to catch him off guard and gauge his reaction regarding the burglary. While Lenny's approach may not be conventional, it could still provide valuable information.

Based on the information provided in the story, the prime suspects are Claire Denninger, Cheryl Compton, Alex Redoff, and Natalie Sampson. Let's analyze the evidence and statements to determine the culprit.

1. The crime scene: Jack Denninger was found dead with his computer smashed beside him, indicating that it was the murder weapon.

2. Time of death: The medical examiner determined that the time of death was approximately one hour before the detectives arrived, at 1:15.

3. Claire Denninger's alibi: Claire claims to have been at the computer store for the entire hour from 12:30 to 1:30, buying a new computer for her husband as a surprise. However, there is no confirmation or witness to support her claim.

4. Cheryl Compton's alibi: Cheryl claims to have been browsing around the mall during that hour but doesn't have anyone to corroborate her story.

5. Natalie Sampson's motive: Natalie accuses Claire and Cheryl of being involved in a love triangle with Jack. She says that Jack promised to break off their relationship but they argue and may have had a motive to kill him.

6. Alex Redoff's arrival: Alex arrives late due to a dental emergency but claims to be Jack's writing partner, collaborating on a science fiction novel. He denies any involvement.

Based on the evidence and statements, it is clear that the most likely culprit is Natalie Sampson. Here's the reasoning:

1. Motive: Natalie had a romantic relationship with Jack, and he promised to break it off with her. This provides a motive for Natalie to be involved in the crime.

2. Emotion and threat: Natalie exhibits emotional distress upon seeing Jack's body and threatens Claire, Cheryl, and Alex, suggesting strong emotions and a personal connection to the crime.

3. Opportunity: Natalie's late arrival ensures she could have been at the crime scene around the time of death, considering she claims to be the fiancée.

4. Jack's engagement: If Natalie was engaged to Jack, it adds credibility to the statements regarding their relationship and her involvement in his life.

However, it is important to note that this deduction is based solely on the information provided in the story and subject to interpretation. Additional information may change the conclusion.

3. Johnny suspects that the killer is at the table with them during breakfast.
4. The killer had an opportunity to poison Eddie's coffee while everyone was distracted by the news of President Reagan's shooting.
5. Johnny found a half-empty bottle of poison in a cabinet drawer a couple of months after Eddie's death.
6. Tim brewed and poured the coffee before the cups were taken to the table. Al was already at the table before the coffee was poured.
7. Johnny served the coffee to everyone, and Eddie was the last one served.
8. Watson noticed an inch of standing water in one of the cups after he poured the coffee.

Based on these clues, we can make the following deductions:

1. The murder happened in 1981, so the culprit must still be alive and present in the ROB Club.
2. The poison was in the cup before Johnny served the coffee.

Based on deduction #2, we can eliminate Johnny as a suspect since he served the coffee after the poison was already in the cup. 

Next, we need to further analyze the actions and statements of the remaining suspects:

1. Al - He arrived at the table before the coffee was poured.
2. Tim - He brewed and poured the coffee.
3. Watson - He noticed an inch of standing water in one of the cups after he poured the coffee.
4. Ray - No specific actions or statements related to the murder are mentioned.

Based on the information provided, the most suspicious individual is Watson. He poured the coffee and noticed something unusual in one of the cups after pouring it. This indicates that he may have been involved in tampering with the coffee.

Therefore, Watson is the prime suspect in the murder of Eddie.
The suspects are Al Gibson,Johnny Woodward,Ray Shields,Tim Acord,Watson Treadway

1. Concerned Neighbor mentions finding food wrappings on their lawn that looked like fast food with traces of mustard and ketchup.
2. Smug in Suburbia blames the lack of police protection and suggests hiring more police officers to solve the littering problem.
3. Perplexed Dog Walker witnessed litter being thrown out of a car's driver side window along the route she walks her dog. She saw this happen around 1 o'clock in the morning and believes it was deliberate.
4. Confused Commuter saw someone stealing a garbage container from behind a fast food restaurant on Route 12.

From these clues, we can infer that the litterer is likely the individual mentioned by Perplexed Dog Walker who was throwing litter out of their car's window. The observation of fast food wrappers with mustard and ketchup by Concerned Neighbor aligns with the description of the litter. Therefore, further investigation should focus on identifying the driver responsible for littering along Elm, leading into Maple Street.

Based on the information provided, the most likely culprit is Cynthia Peck. Here is the step-by-step analysis:

1. Cynthia Peck was late for work and arrived at the office at around 6:45 AM.
2. Megan Brewer, the administrative assistant, arrived at 6:59 AM.
3. Josh Kesler, a member of the marketing team, arrived at 7:25 AM.
4. Steve Ledbetter, the company president, arrived at 7:40 AM.
5. The victim, Trent Willis, had a scheduled meeting with Cynthia Peck at 8:15 AM.
6. Megan Brewer found Trent Willis dead in Cynthia Peck's office at 7:51 AM.
7. The only people who had access to Cynthia Peck's office were Cynthia herself and Megan Brewer, who left her key momentarily on her desk in the outer office.
8. Security records show that all four individuals (Cynthia Peck, Megan Brewer, Josh Kesler, and Steve Ledbetter) accessed the sixth floor before 7:51 AM, the time when the victim was found.
9. Lightning knocked out the security cameras, so it is not possible to determine exactly when the victim entered the office.
10. Cynthia Peck left the office at 6:49 AM to retrieve a contract she had left at home. She returned to the office after an hour and 46 minutes due to heavy rain and traffic.
11. Cynthia Peck made several phone calls from her car, which can be verified through telephone company records.
12. Megan Brewer did not notice anything out of the ordinary when she arrived at 6:59 AM, other than the lightning outside.
13. Josh Kesler arrived at 7:25 AM and did not notice anything unusual.
14. Steve Ledbetter, the company president, mentioned that he does not wear a raincoat because he has a car and driver at his disposal.
15. Josh Kesler mentioned that he does not have a raincoat but has an umbrella, which is drying in his office.

Based on the above information, there are a few factors that point to Cynthia Peck as the most likely culprit:
- Cynthia had access to her office and was scheduled to meet the victim.
- Cynthia left the office for a significant amount of time, during which the murder could have taken place.
- The rain and traffic delays would provide an opportunity for her to commit the crime without being detected.
- Cynthia made several phone calls from her car, which can be verified by telephone company records to confirm her alibi.

Therefore, based on the provided information, it is most likely that Cynthia Peck is the murderer.

Based on the information provided in the story, the culprit appears to be Linda Eberlie. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The murder weapon, a real gun mistaken for a prop, was placed on the props table by Linda Eberlie, the Straw Hat Theater's prop master. This suggests she had easy access to the gun and the opportunity to switch it with the prop gun.

2. Linda borrowed the gun from Arthur Glendon, the director, in the past and returned it after the last performance of another show.

3. Stella Marlowe, the victim, had a history of difficult relationships and had recently broken up with Sam Watson, the leading man, to reconcile with her former and wealthy boyfriend, Josh Whitehead.

4. Sam Watson, being a gun enthusiast and known to spend time in his dressing room with hunting and fishing magazines, had noticed that the gun on the props table was slightly heavier than the prop gun used in previous performances. However, he didn't make anything of it at the time.

5. During the final scene, Sam Watson unintentionally fired the gun straight at Stella Marlowe, which resulted in her murder.

6. Josh Whitehead, the former boyfriend, claims to have no knowledge or involvement in the crime. He also mentions being unable to buy a gun in Vermont.

7. Linda Eberlie suggests that Stella Marlowe may have switched the real gun with the prop gun in an attempt to ensure that Sam Watson and Linda never got together. Linda also states that she won't be attending the memorial ceremony, implying guilt or involvement.

8. Linda's motive for the murder could be revenge for Stella stealing her boyfriend and sabotaging her relationship with Sam Watson.

Based on these observations, it is likely that Linda Eberlie is the culprit behind the murder of Stella Marlowe.
The suspects are Arthur Glendon,Josh Whitehead,Linda Eberlie,Sam Watson,Stella Marlowe

Based on the information provided, the possible culprits for the missing $400 are Martha Gilmont, the cashier at the box office, and John Franklin, the Treasurer.

Here are the steps to determine the culprit:

1. Evaluate the financial situation:
- The theater's bills have not been paid in full and there are carry-over balances from the previous month's bills.
- The manager suspects that money is missing.

2. Interview Basil Carmody:
- Basil is the accountant for the Straw Hat Theater Company.
- He picks up cash and checks from Martha Gilmont, the cashier, every Sunday evening after the performance.
- Basil counts the receipts together with Martha and deposits the money in the bank on Monday morning.
- Basil states that Martha has never made a mistake and the cash and checks are always correct.

3. Gather information about the banking process:
- John Franklin, the Treasurer, logs in to the Vermont Enterprise Bank account to check bank balances and writes checks for payment.
- Lawrence Blake, the Head Teller at the bank, confirms that Basil regularly makes deposits and provides receipts.
- The previous bills were only partially paid because there was not enough money.

4. Interview Martha Gilmont:
- Martha explains the box office procedures, including the discounts offered for season tickets and the First Thursday special prices.
- Martha keeps a precise record of receipts, performance by performance, and each performance record is countersigned by Basil Carmody.
- Martha reveals that she sees the show until halfway through the first act, and then she locks the outside door and goes to the office to do the receipts.

5. Interview John Franklin:
- John confirms the process of receiving bills and writing checks for payment.
- John logs in to the checking account online to check balances and ensures that funds are available before writing checks.
- John explains that he did not pay the power company and caterer in full the previous month due to insufficient funds.

6. Interview Lawrence Blake:
- Lawrence confirms that Basil Carmody regularly makes deposits and receives receipts for them.
- Lawrence approves that the checks signed by John Franklin come in later.

7. Identify discrepancies in the box office receipts:
- Arthur Glendon, the Resident Director, notices that the discount coupons presented at the box office are xerox copies, not originals.

8. Determine the culprit:
Based on the information gathered, the most likely culprit for the missing $400 is Martha Gilmont, the cashier at the box office. Here's the reasoning:
- Martha is the only person involved in handling the cash receipts before they are deposited in the bank.
- She has access to the box office and is responsible for keeping the performance records and coupons.
- The xerox copies of discount coupons suggest that Martha may be involved in fraudulent activities.
- Martha's behavior of leaving the box office halfway through the first act could be an opportunity for her to manipulate the cash or records.
- It is possible that Martha is skimming money from the box office receipts before she counts them with Basil Carmody.

To confirm Martha as the culprit and gather solid proof, it would be necessary to conduct a thorough investigation or observation of her activities. However, based on the given information, Martha Gilmont appears to be the most likely suspect for the missing $400.

Based on the information provided in the story, the culprit responsible for the accident is Arthur Glendon, the Resident Director. 

Here is the step-by-step analysis:

1. Mrs. Danvers, played by Grace Upshaw, is supposed to enter the stage from stage right during the Third Act. However, she disappears from view after crossing the stage and falls through the trapdoor, resulting in a minor injury.

2. The trapdoor was bolted from below, meaning someone with access to the lower stairs could have shot the bolt and braced the trapdoor with a yardstick. The yardstick was found snapped in half, indicating that it was purposely weakened to give way under someone's weight. 

3. Since the actresses' dressing rooms are on the right side of the stage, anyone with access to the lower stairs and the doorway leading downstairs could have committed the act unnoticed. None of the four actresses, including the understudies Samantha Powers and Molly Trumbull, has an alibi for the start of Act Three.

4. Arthur Glendon, the Resident Director, shows up and asks how the investigation is going. The narrator states that they know HOW the accident was arranged and WHO did it, implying that Arthur Glendon is the culprit. The WHY behind his actions is yet to be determined.

Therefore, Arthur Glendon is the prime suspect responsible for orchestrating the accident involving Mrs. Danvers.

Based on the information provided, all the guests are potential suspects: Mr. Fairbank, Mrs. Fairbank, and Mr. Rhys. 

To determine the culprit, let's look at the evidence:

1. Mrs. Rhys was the victim and tested positive for cyanide poisoning. Her death was instantaneous, ruling out suicide.
2. Mrs. Rhys had a motive for murder as she left a will naming each of the other guests as beneficiaries.
3. There were four expected guests at the party, but only three were present.

Now, let's analyze the information regarding the drinks:

1. Mr. Fairbank opened the bottles and helped himself to a drink from each one before falling asleep.
2. The other guests helped themselves to drinks before sitting down.
3. Two glasses on the central table contained green liquid residue, similar to the grasshopper cocktails.
4. The odd one out was a glass with a creamy white mixture at the bottom. Mr. Rhys claimed this was his glass, stating he preferred White Russians.

Finally, let's examine the ashtray evidence:

1. A large metal receptacle was found in front of Maisy's glass, containing six cigarette butts.
2. Five of the cigarette butts were Camels, which belonged to Maisy as she was trying to quit smoking.
3. One of the cigarette butts was a Marlboro, which belonged to Mrs. Fairbank.

Considering the information provided, the culprit is likely Mrs. Fairbank.

1. She had a motive as Mrs. Rhys' death would benefit her as a beneficiary of the will.
2. Mrs. Fairbank was the only one who drank White Russians, and the odd glass contained a creamy white mixture, matching her preferred drink.
3. Her cigarette butt, a Marlboro, was found in the ashtray, indicating her presence at the scene.

2. The money was stolen from Zelda's trailer while she was briefly away to get a permit for the sheriff.

2. The Great Marchelli, the high-wire performer: He had a motive to sabotage his own act to cast suspicion on Lorenzo and ensure he would never be promoted into his place. However, his actions and performance do not align with someone attempting to steal money.

1. Joe was walking alone in the corn maze with the engagement ring when he was attacked and lost consciousness.
2. When Joe woke up, the ring was missing and he noticed footprints of the person who attacked him.
3. Joe's brothers, Nick, Austin, and Billy, were all in the farmhouse when Joe returned and claimed they were not involved in the incident.
4. Nick claims to have been working on the tractor near the barn.
5. Austin claims he hasn't left the house all day.
6. Billy claims he was helping Austin with lunch and then got lost in the corn maze while searching for Joe.

Based on this information, we can eliminate Billy as a suspect. He was inside the house helping Austin and then got lost in the corn maze while looking for Joe.

Now we are left with two suspects - Nick and Austin.

To determine the culprit, we need to consider the timing of the incident. Joe found himself alone in the corn maze after being attacked and before being found by Billy. During this time, Nick claims to have been working on the tractor near the barn and Austin claims to have been inside the house the whole time.

Since Joe was attacked in the corn maze, it is highly unlikely that Nick had time to commit the assault, steal the ring, and then return to the barn unnoticed. Therefore, we can eliminate Nick as a suspect.

This leaves Austin as the prime suspect, as he could have easily left the house, attacked Joe, and taken the ring without Joe's knowledge. Austin's claim of not leaving the house can be seen as an attempt to provide an alibi.

Therefore, based on the deductions and the information provided, Austin is the most likely culprit who stole the engagement ring.
The suspects are Austin,Billy,Nick

Based on the information provided, the most likely culprit is Jeffery Sharp, the computer tech. Here's the reasoning:

1. Both George Wilson and Donna Blake were present at the office party celebrating the completion of the new computer chip. They left the office together with everyone else and returned in the morning.

2. Donna Blake was busy preparing reports and fixing mistakes in the morning, and she was the first person to enter the office after the party at 6:10 am.

3. The night janitor, Pete Thompson, claims to have come in at 1:00 am to clean up after the party and left around 4:00 am. He had a second job that he went to, and the timing seems to match up.

4. The office manager, George Wilson, discovered the chaotic scene in his office when he arrived. He claimed that the safe was blown open and its contents were missing.

5. Jeffery Sharp, the computer tech, had been working to wrap up computer maintenance before leaving on a two-week vacation. He seemed agitated, and his plane was leaving in less than three hours.

6. When asked to provide a list of people who had been in the office since the party, Jeffery handed over a short printout showing only Donna Blake and George Wilson entering in the morning. This means he hadn't entered the office himself after the party.

7. Jeffery was also the only person who could potentially tamper with the security system, as he had limited access to adjust it. If he had tampered with the system, all access would be shut off, including entry and exit.

8. Mr. Connelly, the head of security at the chip manufacturer's corporate offices, confirmed that there was no system malfunction that would allow the janitor to enter without using his access card.

9. Jeffery, in his hurry to catch his flight, waved his tickets around and threw them down on top of the "office access" printout. This behavior seems odd and highlights his desperate urge to leave.

Based on these points, it appears that Jeffery Sharp, the computer tech, had the opportunity and motivation to commit the theft. He was the only person who could potentially tamper with the security system and had a strong motive to obtain the new computer chip.

1. Wayne: He was watching the California election returns on TV during the time the car was stolen. His favorite candidate, Robert Kennedy, had just won, so it would be unlikely for him to steal the car, as he was preoccupied with the news and its aftermath.

2. Sherry: She was at work during the time the car was stolen. Although we don't have specific details about her workplace or anyone who could vouch for her whereabouts, it seems unlikely that she could have stolen the car and left work unnoticed.

Based on the details provided in the story, the protagonist, Sam Jaspers, is able to identify the thief. Let's review the key points:

1. Sam Jaspers is a night shift worker at the Palace Diner, responsible for cleaning and washing dishes.
2. The owner of the diner is Tom Greene, who left early on the night in question.
3. Louisa Perry is the waitress on duty and also does short-order cooking after Tom leaves.
4. Mary Ingram is a regular customer who was present in the restaurant around midnight.
5. John Beddington, a college student known to Sam, came in for a cup of coffee and told Sam about a missed assignment.
6. Sarah Upton is an unfamiliar customer who struck up a conversation with Mary and later shared her table.
7. Sam decides to clean the restrooms after 1:00 a.m.
8. Sam finds a tapestry bag with money in it hanging in the last toilet stall of the ladies' room.
9. Sam remembers an old lady with a walker who had a similar tapestry bag, which was left behind on her booth.
10. Sam realizes the old lady couldn't have gone to the ladies' room due to the inaccessible stairs.
11. Sam calls Tom, who instructs him to count the money and keep the bag safe.
12. Sam wraps the tapestry bag in vacuum cleaner bags and puts it in his locker.
13. Sam sits at a back table to read a history book while Louisa does inventory work. John leaves for his dorm.
14. Mary finishes her coffee, goes to the ladies' room, comes out looking fresh, and leaves the diner.
15. Sarah lingers a bit but eventually says goodbye to Sam and Louisa before leaving.
16. Tom returns to the diner and receives confirmation from Sam that the tapestry bag is secure. Sam also claims to know the thief.

Given these details, the thief can be identified as Louisa Perry, the waitress on duty. Here's the reasoning behind this conclusion:

1. Louisa is the only person mentioned to have a clear view of both restrooms while doing inventory work at the counter.
2. Sam mentions that Louisa's foul mood discouraged conversation when Sarah approached the counter.
3. Louisa is present at the counter when Mary goes to the ladies' room and when she returns looking fresh before leaving the diner.
4. Louisa is the only person left in the diner when Sarah finally says goodbye and leaves.

Next, we consider each suspect's potential motives and opportunities to steal the dollhouse:

1. Kyle: While he had a small scandal involving crashing his car, there is no direct evidence or motive provided that links him to the theft. He has been with Fiona since the previous night and does not have any reason to steal the dollhouse.

2. Julia: As a party planner, she is focused on her career and has organized parties for many people. However, there is no direct evidence or motive provided that links her to the theft.

1. The story mentions that Tom has a "mighty fearful temper" and was "bashed in the head when he was a boy by an overseer." This suggests that Tom may have anger issues and can act violently.

2. After Reverend Gray goes to check on the commotion outside, he sees Tom in the corner of the cellar, and Tom's shoes are covered in feathers. This indicates that Tom had been in the chicken coop.

3. Bertha, Tom's mother, had gone outside before anyone heard Ro shout. This is suspicious, as it suggests that Bertha may have been involved in the incident.

1. Jane Neal: She claims to have traveled around the country with a group of merry pranksters after high school graduation, worked on Robert Kennedy's campaign, and currently lives in a commune in Idaho. Her story includes details about her disillusionment with the Vietnam War and ongoing issues with drug abuse. 

2. Billy Flowers: He mentions being surprised and pleased to reunite with Terry on E-Friends. His life has been happier compared to Jane's, and he is happily married with children and grandchildren. His political beliefs also shifted from conservative to liberal.

3. Larry Gerard: He spent almost 30 years in the US State Department, mainly abroad. Currently, he lives in Texas and spends time at the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library for research on a book about the Johnson presidency. He has a successful professional life and a happy personal life with his wife, Linda.

4. Paula Newsome: After college, she joined a major television network and played a significant role in producing the historical Bicentennial Minutes television segments during the U.S. bicentennial celebration in 1976. The series won an Emmy award, and Paula is currently retired and living in Los Angeles.

5. Jimmy Smith: He was involved in a car accident in 1981 and spent time in the hospital and rehabilitation. Since then, he and his second wife opened their own rehabilitation center and have been physical therapy instructors in Kansas City for over 20 years.

To determine who is telling the truth, we need to look for any inconsistencies or contradictions among their stories. 

1. Jane Neal's story seems inconsistent due to the timeline of events. She claims to have traveled with merry pranksters after high school graduation, which suggests it happened in the late 1960s. However, she also mentions working on Robert Kennedy's campaign in 1968. If she traveled with the merry pranksters after high school, it would have been after 1968, making it unlikely for her to have worked on the campaign.

2. Billy Flowers' story seems consistent and does not contain any obvious contradictions or inconsistencies.

3. Larry Gerard's story also seems consistent, with no apparent contradictions or inconsistencies.

4. Paula Newsome's story is consistent and does not contain any obvious contradictions or inconsistencies.

5. Jimmy Smith's story is consistent and does not contain any obvious contradictions or inconsistencies.

Based on the analysis above, the only person whose story contains a potential contradiction is Jane Neal. Therefore, Jane Neal is the culprit in this mystery.

1. The thefts occurred at different locations: Home Depot, Safeway, and The Elegant Jewelry Shop.
2. Sarah Browne, Morris Emerson, Johnny Anderson, and Tom Blankenship were all present at each of the three incidents, except for Sarah, who was at the movies when Charley Eastern's wallet was stolen at Safeway.
3. In the Sam Cartwright theft at Home Depot, all four of them were present, but there is no evidence linking any of them directly to the theft.
4. However, Charley Eastern noticed Tom Blankenship leaving the Safeway just before he left the store and discovered his wallet missing. This suggests that Tom may have taken the wallet.
5. In the Mayor Greenleaf theft at The Elegant Jewelry Shop, all four of them were present, and Tom was the last to leave the store before the wallet was found on the sidewalk.

Based on the information provided, the possible suspects are John, Horace, Lewis, and Jake. 

- John has muddy footprints matching the tread of his boots leading from the doorway to the center of the living room where the cabinet with the diamond was located and then back out again. 
- Horace is described as being able to shrink into the background and does not seem to have any specific evidence against him at this point. 
- Lewis is a tall man and is trying to blend in by sitting in a chair. 
- Jake is the only suspect who has spoken up and provided information about the whereabouts of each person during the day.

To determine the culprit, we need to consider the clues given. 

First, Mr. Seppings mentioned that the window was broken and should have remained shut until it was fixed. However, there are no ladder marks indicating someone had climbed in or out of the window.

Next, we know that the footprints on the carpet leading to and from the cabinet where the diamond was stolen match John's boots. John insists that he did not take the diamond.

Considering these pieces of evidence, it can be concluded that John is the most likely culprit. The muddy footprints from his boots lead directly to the cabinet, suggesting that he had access to it. The fact that the window was broken but without ladder marks indicates that someone inside the house likely opened it. Since John was working in the backyard, he would have had access to the window from the outside and could have opened it to gain entry.

Therefore, based on the available information, the culprit who stole the diamond is John.

1. The hall closet: Since Dad had seen Andy and Matthew open and shut the closet door earlier, it is unlikely that Matthew is hiding there.
2. Andy’s room: There was a spill of water at the entrance, suggesting that Andy had dropped an uncovered glass of water there. It is unlikely that Matthew is hiding in Andy’s room.

Based on the information provided, there are a few suspects in this mystery:

1. Lorraine Wellington: Lorraine had the wristwatch and showed it to Josie and her mother the night before. She is also the one who reported the theft and seemed worried and suspicious of Josie and her mother.

2. Josie Morales: Josie and her mother were the ones invited to Lorraine's guest cottage and knew about the hiding place of the watch. Josie also had the opportunity to steal the watch since she had a key.

3. Lester Wellington: Although not directly implicated, Lester joked about receiving a police escort and seemed relatively unaffected by the situation. It is unclear if he had any involvement.

4. Cindy (the maid): Cindy had a key to the guest cottage and the opportunity to tamper with the vase and find the watch inside.

To determine the culprit, we can examine the clues provided:

1. The vase was smashed to bits, indicating someone was searching for the watch or trying to destroy evidence.
2. Mrs. Wellington mentioned her arthritis, making it difficult for her to clutch the key ring.
3. Josie and her mother had a copy of the key to the cottage.
4. Cindy starts her cleaning when Mr. and Mrs. Wellington are asleep and has a key to all the rooms.

Considering these clues, the most likely culprit is Cindy, the maid. Here's the reasoning:

- Lorraine had the watch but said it was stolen, making it less likely that she stole it herself.
- Josie and her mother had the opportunity to steal the watch, but it is unlikely that they would risk their newfound business opportunity.
- Lester's involvement is unclear, but there is no direct evidence implicating him.
- Cindy had access to the cottage because she had a key, and she started her cleaning while Lorraine and Lester were asleep. If she knew the hiding spot and had access to the cottage, she could have stolen the watch. The fact that she had the key and was cleaning nearby suggests she had both opportunity and means.

Based on the information provided, the potential suspects are Tom Gooding, Randolph Johnson, Sarah Conrad, and Morris Ingalls. To identify the culprit, we need to analyze their alibis and any motives they might have.

1. Tom Gooding: He had a dinner with the victim the night before the murder and claimed that they were discussing business matters. Gooding said that Randall wanted to leave his business due to concerns about federal regulations. However, Gooding mentioned that his firm did not have an opening for Randall because his business was unethical. Gooding had no hard feelings towards Randall, but he disliked him in high school. No clear motive for murder is given.

2. Randolph Johnson: He mentioned that he saw the victim in the washroom of the B and B where they were both staying. However, Johnson had taken out his contact lenses and couldn't clearly see Randall, although he recognized his general shape. Johnson heard someone else in the washroom saying they couldn't see without contact lenses, but Johnson left before seeing who it was. He didn't have a strong relationship with the victim and seemed unsure if he saw Randall later that night. No clear motive for murder is given.

3. Sarah Conrad: Conrad hadn't seen the victim since high school, but they had discussed getting married in the past. The engagement was broken, and Conrad believed it was due to the influence of Randall's parents. She was looking forward to having lunch with him during the reunion. Conrad tried to visit him at the B and B but couldn't get into the building without a key. Conrad had rehearsed scenarios in her mind, but the interview doesn't provide a clear motive for murder.

4. Morris Ingalls: He was a classmate of the victim in both high school and college, and they even roomed together. Ingalls had a crush on Sarah Conrad himself and was disappointed when the victim broke up with her. He didn't have a strong friendship with Randall but mentioned having a conversation with him in the washroom during the reunion. Ingalls overheard Randall saying that Conrad would never be on the Supreme Court and that he could "fix that" somehow. It is unclear what Randall meant by this statement.

Based on the information provided, Morris Ingalls is the most likely culprit. He had a previous crush on Sarah Conrad and seemed resentful towards the victim for breaking up with her. Additionally, he overheard the victim making a vague statement about Conrad not being on the Supreme Court and that he could "fix that." This suggests that Ingalls may have had a motive to harm the victim and potentially derail Conrad's career aspirations. However, further investigation would be needed to confirm his guilt.

Based on the information provided, the main suspects are Jade Foster, Madelyn Reader, Jock Mat, and Max Crabgrass, along with the security guard. 

- Jade claims to have been studying at the time of the incident but later throws down her purse, revealing a red shirt. She could be the arsonist, as the security camera footage showed a figure wearing a red hoodie.
- Madelyn denies involvement and states she was trying to get someone to do her homework. However, she was seen hanging around the crime scene just before the attack.
- Jock's football jersey was found in the library, suggesting he may have been involved. He claims his jersey was missing, and he was running laps as punishment.
- Max denies involvement and states he was helping his homeroom teacher, but a red sweatshirt was worn by the arsonist.
- The security guard was acting suspiciously when Lilly was investigating, but he claims he was watching her to ensure her safety.

Considering all the evidence, the most likely arsonist is Jade Foster. The security camera footage showed a figure in a red hoodie, and Jade had a red shirt in her purse. Additionally, Jade received an F in reading, and the library being burnt down could be a possible motive for her.

Based on the information provided, the culprit responsible for the vandalism is Brittany. 

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The vandalism occurred between the time the posters were hung up late afternoon and before school the next day.
2. The only potential suspects are the other candidates - Marie, Brittany, Norma, and Isis.
3. Marie and Jacelyn, the narrator, were together during this time, hanging up posters and going home together.
4. Norma and Isis were in the art room together sorting out paints, but they both left briefly to wash their hands, during which the paint and brushes went missing.
5. However, Isis confirmed that the paint was back in its place the next morning, and Norma mentioned not going into the art room again.
6. Brittany claimed to have been retaking a math test during this time and mentioned passing by the art room.
7. Jacelyn noticed that the only two posters that were not vandalized belonged to Norma and Isis, which were hanging lower and could have been missed in a rush.
8. Jacelyn realized that the culprit must have been in a rush, possibly to retake a math test (matching Brittany's claim).
9. During the meeting, Jacelyn gathered everyone in the student council room and accused the culprit, stating that the vandal was present in the room.
10. Since Brittany was the only candidate with a clear motive (having her own posters vandalized), passing by the art room at the time, and being in a rush, she is revealed as the culprit.

Based on the information provided, the evidence points towards Jon as the culprit who stole the cake. Here is the step-by-step deduction:

1. Jon is the mischievous son who always jokes about stealing a slice of cake when his mother refuses to give it to him.
2. Jimmy witnesses Jon near the cake with a missing piece and his finger covered in chocolate.
3. Maria confronts Jon about the missing cake, and he denies eating it, claiming that he came inside for lunch and a drink, not to eat the cake.

Based on the information provided, the perpetrator of the necklace theft is Jessica, the client's daughter. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The safe, from which the necklace was taken, is under the colorful Persian carpet in the study. It can only be opened with a key from the client's bedroom nightstand.
2. The necklace was insured for almost 2 million dollars, suggesting that the offender is likely known to family members.
3. The day before the crime was Jessica's sixteenth birthday, and there were a total of fifty people in the house, including family members and servants.
4. Access to the study and the bedroom was mostly disabled to protect the valuable item. Only one guard was present on the top of the stairs.
5. The possibility of access from the outside was examined, but nothing suggested the placement of a ladder or someone standing there.
6. The object was last seen ten days ago, and the client routinely checks the safe every ten days.
7. Two cleaning ladies came once a week but were under surveillance by someone from the family.
8. Security protection at the house is minimum, except for important events like birthdays.
9. The security videos from the past ten days, including the day of the birthday celebration, did not show any suspicious or unknown person.
10. The client's wife, daughter, and housekeeper (Mrs. Neil) were considered as possible suspects. Mrs. Neil had kleptomania but was exonerated due to her disorder being under control and immense family trust.
11. The location of the key was known only to the client and his wife.
12. The client mentioned that his wife didn't care about the necklace and questioned why he wouldn't sell it. Upon this mention, Jessica, the daughter, nervously intertwined her fingers.
13. When asked if she knew where the key was, Jessica denied knowing its whereabouts. Her mother then got angry, but the father intervened before she could finish her outburst.

Based on these clues, it can be concluded that Jessica is the culprit. She had access to the house and had knowledge of the necklace. Her nervous reaction to the mention of the key suggests that she may be involved in its disappearance.

Based on the information provided, we need to analyze the alibis and actions of each suspect to determine who the likely culprit is. 

1. Mario Marcino: He visited his wife's office before arriving at the town hall. He forgot his script at his wife's office and called her at 7:05. He arrived at the town hall at around 7:20. Mario's alibi seems solid as he had no reason to harm Robert Nesnick. 

2. Marie Carloette: She arrived early and had to wait outside until 6:55, as Mario and Robert were the only ones with a key. She had coffee with Robert, Bruce, and Mario at around 7:05, then went to the washroom to refresh her make-up. She came out at around 7:25. Marie's alibi also seems solid as she was with others during the time of the murder.

3. Bruce Whittingley: Bruce arrived at 6:57 and saw Mario, Robert, and Marie having coffee. He made the coffee for everyone. He saw Marie leave for the washroom at 7:08 and Robert leave shortly afterward to check on props behind the stage. Bruce joined Mario in smoking a cigarette from 7:15 to 7:20. At 7:30, Bruce went to the washroom and discovered Robert's body. Bruce's alibi seems solid as well, as he was with Mario during the time of the murder.

By analyzing their alibis, it does not appear that any of the three suspects had the opportunity or motive to commit the murder. However, there is one detail that stands out - Marie's actions. She went to refresh her make-up at around 7:05 and came out at around 7:25. This means there was a 20-minute window where Marie was alone and unaccounted for. 

Based on this information, Marie Carloette is the likely culprit. She had the opportunity and time to commit the murder. Therefore, Michael Rembrant pointed at Marie and accused her of first-degree murder.

2. Mrs. Dunwoodee was in her room nursing her ankle and was unable to move around easily.

3. Brad has a known allergy to leather, which would make it uncomfortable for him to sit on the leather sofa in the living room. He claims to have been in the kitchen pouring himself some cider when the theft occurred.

4. Ricky arrived just ten minutes before the questioning, claiming to have been at his house to fetch a CD. He drove for about 30 minutes to retrieve it.

After considering all the information, the key clue is that Ricky brought back a CD that Alex had given him. Since the book was stolen just half an hour ago, it would be impossible for him to have obtained it during that time.

Based on the information given, there are a few potential suspects: the mother, father, Uncle Henry, Aunt Mary, Uncle John, and the maid. We can eliminate some of the suspects based on the information provided. 

The mother had already finished eating her meal and went to bed early, so it is unlikely that she is the culprit. Additionally, there is no evidence or motive mentioned for her.

As for the father, he walked in a strange way and appeared to be trying not to limp. This could be a potential clue, but it's not enough to conclude that he is guilty.

Uncle Henry and Aunt Mary were seen examining a small hole in the wall but do not seem relevant to the stolen necklace.

Uncle John passed by the children and accidentally stepped on one of their feet. While this may seem suspicious, it is not enough evidence to directly link him to the theft.

That leaves us with the maid as a potential suspect. It is mentioned that she is not allowed inside the room where the necklace was stolen, making her innocent in this case.

The clues that help identify the culprit are the print on the soft carpet near the cupboard and the small footprint by the cupboard. These clues suggest that someone small, like a child, might have been involved in taking the necklace.

Based on these pieces of evidence and the fact that the story is narrated by a child, it is most likely that the culprit is the younger sister, Sarah. She is bolder and more daring than the narrator, and the footprint near the cupboard suggests her involvement.

Therefore, Sarah is the most likely culprit in stealing the necklace.
The suspects are Aunt Mary,Dad,Mom,Uncle Henry,Uncle John

Based on the information provided, the culprit who stole the wallet is Carson Thomson. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The only people present during the incident were Buchanan, Nader, Thomson, and Garcia.
2. Thomson was the one who noticed his wallet was missing after leaving the restaurant and trying to purchase a newspaper.
3. Thomson claims he left his wallet on the table within arm's reach of Buchanan and Nader, implying that one of them stole it.
4. Buchanan and Nader both deny seeing the wallet on the table.
5. Haven, the detective, observes each suspect closely.
6. Haven notices that Buchanan has two large economics books with scrap-paper bookmarks and a gold pen in his pocket.
7. Nader has chalk smudges and half a leaf stuck to his coat's wrist, indicating he was likely engaged in a different activity, not stealing the wallet.
8. Garcia has a simple outfit with a notebook and pencil, indicating no suspicious behavior.
9. Thomson's appearance and behavior raise suspicions: he has thick-rimmed glasses, is wearing a too-big suit, has a corduroy hat, and tightly knotted shoelaces.
10. Thomson also has a pair of glasses sticking out of his breast pocket, suggesting he may have used them as a distraction or to create confusion.
11. Thomson is the only one who objects to being searched, indicating guilt.
12. Haven states that he knows not only who took the wallet but also where it's hidden, suggesting he has found evidence or deduced the culprit.
13. Based on the provided information, there is no conclusive evidence that points to someone other than Carson Thomson as the thief.
The suspects are Bill Buchanan,Carson Thomson,Cooper,David Nader,Vincent Garcia
