The only people who knew about the TV were Rick and Phil. Phil was the delivery man who brought the TV to Uncle Charlie's house. Rick was Uncle Charlie's neighbor, who'd been teasing him about his obsession with football. And Rick had a broken arm, so he couldn't have stolen the TV. And Phil the delivery man had a good alibi. He'd been busy all morning. The only person who had both a motive and an opportunity was Uncle Charlie himself. He'd ordered the TV, and he'd arranged for it to be delivered to his house. But he was the only person who knew that the TV had arrived. He'd told his wife, Aunt Mary, that he was going to watch the Super Bowl on his new TV. But he hadn't told anyone else about it. And he'd left the TV in his den, where it was easy for him to steal it.
The suspects are Aunt Mary,Phil,Rick,Uncle Charlie
