<s>[INST]Cole is on the varsity basketball team. Is Cole over 6 feet tall? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Cole is under 7 feet tall. 
2. Every player on Cole's varsity basketball team is above 6'1".

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
 (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Here's why:

Statement 1: Cole is under 7 feet tall.
This statement alone is insufficient to determine whether Cole is over 6 feet tall. Cole could be anywhere between 5'1" and 6'5" and still be under 7 feet tall.

Statement 2: Every player on Cole's varsity basketball team is above 6'1".
This statement alone is also insufficient to determine whether Cole is over 6 feet tall. It only tells us that everyone else on the team is above 6'1", but it doesn't give us any information about Cole's height specifically.

Taken together, however, Statements 1 and 2 provide enough information to determine that Cole is indeed over 6 feet tall. We know that Cole is under 7 feet tall (Statement 1), and we know that everyone else on the team is above 6'1" (Statement 2). Therefore, Cole must be at least 6'2" to be on the team.

So, the correct answer is (D).

<s>[INST]Does Alice like elephants more than zebras? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Elephants are Alice's favourite animals. 
2. Zebras are the animals that Alice likes the least.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
 The correct answer is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Statement 1 alone does not provide enough information to determine whether Alice likes elephants more than zebras, as it only tells us that elephants are Alice's favorite animals. It doesn't provide any information about her preference for zebras.

Statement 2 alone does not provide enough information either, as it only tells us that zebras are the animals that Alice likes the least. It doesn't provide any information about her preference for elephants.

However, when we combine both statements, we can conclude that Alice likes elephants more than zebras. This is because we know that elephants are Alice's favorite animals and zebras are the animals she likes the least. This means that Alice must like elephants more than zebras.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
Given answer: D


<s>[INST]All the students in a classroom wrote an exam. How many students are in the classroom? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Five students failed. 
2. One student was 29th from the top and 16th from the bottom.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
 The correct answer is option (D). 

Statement 1 mentions that 5 students failed, which means the total number of students in the classroom must be a multiple of 5. 

Statement 2 reveals that one student was 29th from the top and 16th from the bottom, indicating that the number of students in the classroom is at least 45 (29 +16 + 1 = 45). 

Therefore, by combining statements 1 and 2, we can conclude that the number of students in the classroom is a multiple of 5 and at least 45, which narrows down the possible values to 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, ... . 

So, option (D) is the correct answer: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
 The correct answer is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Here's why:

Statement 1: "Samuel is not facing North"
This statement alone is not sufficient to determine the direction Samuel is facing. It only eliminates one possible direction (North).

Statement 2: "Samuel is facing the sun"
This statement alone is sufficient to determine the direction Samuel is facing. Since the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, if Samuel is facing the sun, he must be facing either east or west.

Taken together, statements 1 and 2 are sufficient to determine the direction Samuel is facing. If Samuel is not facing North (statement 1) and is facing the sun (statement 2), then he must be facing either east or west. Therefore, the correct option is (D).

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
 statement 1: There are no red balls in the basket.
If there are no red balls in the basket, then all the balls in the basket are either blue or green. Therefore, the answer to the question "Are there only blue balls in the basket?" is yes.

So, statement 1 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2: The smallest ball in the basket is green.
This statement doesn' economically imply anything about the existence or lack of blue balls in the basket. It only tells us that there is at least one green ball in the basket.

Therefore, statement 2 alone is not sufficient to answer the question.

So, the correct option is (A): Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: A

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
 Answer: The correct option is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Explanation:

Statement 1: Leonid hates vegetables.
This statement alone is not sufficient to determine whether Leonid likes carrots. It only tells us that Leonid doesn' inconsider vegetables, but it doesn't specifically mention carrots.

Statement 2: Leonid prefers carrots to leeks.
This statement alone is not sufficient to determine whether Leonid likes carrots. It only tells us that Leonid prefers carrots over leeks, but it doesn't necessarily mean that he likes carrots.

Statements 1 and 2 taken together:
If we combine both statements, we can conclude that Leonid hates vegetables, but he prefers carrots to leeks. This implies that while Leonid may not like vegetables in general, he might have a positive attitude towards carrots. Therefore, statements 1 and 2 taken together are sufficient to answer the question.

So, the correct option is (D).

2. Probability of either A or B or both A and B happening is 0.65.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
 The probability of event B occurring can be found by subtracting the probability of event A from 1, as the probability of either A or B or both occurring is 0.65.

Therefore, the correct option is (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient, as we can deduce the probability of event B occurring from the given information.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. Probability of either A or B or both A and B happening is 0.65 (from statement 2).
2. Probability of event A is 0.55 (from statement 1).
3. Therefore, the probability of event B can be found by subtracting the probability of event A from 1:
P(B) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.55 = 0.45

So, the correct answer is option (B).
Given answer: B

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
 The correct answer is option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Here's why:

Statement 1: All buildings with more than 20 floors need a special license.
This statement alone is not sufficient to determine whether the building contractor needs a special license, as we don't know how many floors the building will have.

Statement 2: The building contractor wants to build a 30-storey building.
This statement alone is sufficient to determine that the building contractor needs a special license, since 30 floors is more than the 20-floor threshold mentioned in statement 1.

Taken together, statements 1 and 2 provide enough information to conclude that the building contractor needs a special license. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
 (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Let's analyze both statements:

1. If 5 brick-laying machines work with 5 men, the wall will be built in 7.5 hours. 
This statement gives us information about the time it would take for 5 brick-laying machines and 5 men to build the wall. But it doesn't provide information on how fast the machines work compared to men. So this statement alone is not sufficient.

2. The brick-laying machines work twice as fast as men.
This statement provides information on how fast the machines work compared to men, but it doesn't give us any specific information about the time it would take to build the wall. So this statement alone is not sufficient.

Now, let's consider both statements together:

From statement 1, we know that 5 brick-laying machines and 5 men can build the wall in 7.5 hours.
From statement 2, we know that the machines work twice as fast as men. So if 10 men take 6 hours to build the wall, 5 machines working twice as fast as men will take 6/2 = 3 hours to build the same wall.

Therefore, the total time it would take for 5 brick-laying machines to build the wall is 3 hours.

So, the correct option is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
Given answer: D

2. The sum of the number of people in Ramya's restaurant and Abhinav's restaurant is equal to 70.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
 The question asks for the number of people in Ramya's restaurant, and we have two statements:

1. The number of people in Abhinav's restaurant is at least 10 less than the number of people in Ramya's restaurant.
2. The sum of the number of people in Ramya's restaurant and Abhinav's restaurant is equal to 70.

We can start by analyzing each statement separately:

Statement 1:
This statement tells us that the number of people in Abhinav's restaurant is less than the number of people in Ramya's restaurant, but it doesn' Zafo 't tell us the exact number of people in Ramya's restaurant. For example, if there are 50 people in Abhinav's restaurant, then there could be 60, 70, 80, ... people in Ramya's restaurant. So, statement 1 alone is insufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2:
This statement tells us that the sum of the number of people in Ramya's restaurant and Abhinav's restaurant is equal to 70. Again, we cannot determine the exact number of people in Ramya's restaurant. For example, if there are 50 people in Abhinav's restaurant, then there could be 20, 30, 40, ... people in Ramya's restaurant. So, statement 2 alone is also insufficient to answer the question.

Now, let's consider both statements together:

If we combine both statements, we can conclude that the number of people in Ramya's restaurant is at least 10 more than the number of people in Abhinav's restaurant, and the sum of the two numbers is equal to 70. This means we can set up an equation:

Let x be the number of people in Ramya's restaurant.
Let y be the number of people in Abhinav's restaurant.

From statement 1, we know that y ≤ x - 10.
From statement 2, we know that x + y = 70.

Now we have two equations and two variables. Solving the system of equations, we get:

x = 60
y = 10

Therefore, the number of people in Ramya's restaurant is 60, and the number of people in Abhinav's restaurant is 10.

Since both statements together are sufficient to answer the question, the correct option is:
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
Given answer: D


<s>[INST]Who finished the task in the least amount of time between Liam, Pranav and Salma? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Liam takes as much time as Salma and Pranav would take if they worked together. 
2 Salma takes double the amount of time that Pranav and Liam take working together.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
 The right answer is option (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. Salma takes double the amount of time that Pranav and Liam take working together.

Let's assume Pranav and Liam take x hours to complete the task. Then, Salma will take 2x hours.

2. Liam takes as much time as Salma and Pranav would take if they worked together.

Let's assume Salma and Pranav take y hours to complete the task together. Liam takes y hours as well.

Now, we can create an equation using the two statements:

2x = y + x

Simplifying the equation:

2x = y + x

Subtracting x from both sides:

x = y

Now we know that Salma takes double the time that Pranav and Liam take working together, and Liam takes as much time as Salma and Pranav would take if they worked together. With this information, we can calculate the time taken by each person:

 Salma: 2x
Pranav and Liam: x

Since we know the time taken by each person, we can determine who finished the task in the least amount of time. In this case, Pranav and Liam finished the task in the least amount of time, as they took x hours, while Salma took 2x hours.

Therefore, option (D), Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient, is the correct answer.

<s>[INST]A family has 7 children. How many of the children are boys? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
 The answer is (D).

Let's analyze both statements:

1. "There are fewer girls than boys."

This statement alone is not sufficient to determine the number of boys because it only provides information about the difference in the number of boys and girls. It doesn't give enough information about concrete numbers to answer the question.

2. "Each girl has half as many sisters as brothers."

This statement alone is also not sufficient, as it does not reveal the total number of boys and girls. But if we combine it with the information in statement 1, we can deduce that:

Let X be the number of boys.
According to statement 1, X > (7 - X) Y, where Y is the number of girls. 

According to statement 2, every girl has half as many sisters as brothers. Therefore, Y/2 = X - Y, which implies X = 2Y.

Now, we have two equations: X > 7-X and X= 2Y.
Solving these equations simultaneously, we get X = 4 and Y = 3, making the total number of boys 4.

Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
 The answer is option (D).

Statement 1: Tony correctly states that Qi's birthday is after 2nd and before 5th March.

This statement alone is not sufficient to determine Qi's birthday, as it only narrows down the possible dates to a range of 3rd, 4th, and 5th March.

Statement 2: Brenna incorrectly states that Qi's birthday is on 3rd March.

This statement alone is not sufficient to determine Qi's birthday, as it is incorrect and provides no useful information.

Taken together, Statements 1 and 2 are sufficient to determine Qi's birthday. We know from Statement 1 that Qi's birthday is after 2nd and before 5th March, and we can eliminate 3rd March as an option since Brenna incorrectly stated that it was Qi's birthday. Therefore, Qi's birthday can only be on 4th or 5th March.

Hence, option (D) is the correct answer.

Correct answer: B
 The question asks whether Alexia is a doctor. 

Statement 1: "Either Alexia or Jenny is a doctor."
This statement doesn't provide enough information to determine whether Alexia is a doctor. It only tells us that either Alexia or Jenny is a doctor, but we don't know which one. Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Statement 2: "Alexia and Jenny are a doctor and nurse, respectively."
This statement clearly indicates that Alexia is a doctor and Jenny is a nurse. Therefore, statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

The correct option is B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

 step by step:
1. Statement 1: "Either Alexia or Jenny is a doctor."

* Doesn't provide enough information to determine whether Alexia is a doctor.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
 The question asks whether there will be more crocodile attacks next year.

Statement 1 indicates that there were more crocodile attacks this year than last year, which suggests that there may be a trend of increasing attacks. However, this statement alone does not provide enough information to determine whether there will be more attacks next year. Therefore, Statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Statement 2 reports that 56 people were attacked by crocodiles this year. Without additional context or information, it is impossible to determine whether this number is unusually high or low compared to previous years. Moreover, it does not provide any information about the factors that may influence the frequency of crocodile attacks, such as habitat loss, water quality, or weather patterns. Therefore, Statement 2 alone is also insufficient.

When combined, Statements 1 and 2 provide a little more information. The increasing trend of attacks (Statement 1) and the number of attacks this year (Statement 2) may suggest that there is a higher likelihood of more attacks next year. However, without knowing the factors that contribute to crocodile attacks, it is impossible to make a definitive prediction. Therefore, Statements 1 and 2 taken together are still insufficient to answer the question.

The correct answer is (E): Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient to answer the question.

Therefore, option (E) is the correct answer.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
 (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient. 

Explanation:

Statement 1 informs us that Kofi Annan, a Ghanaian, was the United Nations Secretary-General in 1999. This information alone is insufficient to determine whether African member states formed the largest regional group in the United Nations in 1999.

Statement 2 reveals that the African regional group received the largest fraction of UN aid in 1998. Again, this information alone is insufficient to answer the question. A correlation between UN aid and the size of a regional group within the UN does not exist.

Combining the two statements provides no additional information that could answer the question.

Correct answer: A
 The question asks for the value of x.

Statement 1: x = 3.
This statement alone is sufficient to answer the question, as it directly provides the value of x, which is 3. Therefore, option (A) is correct.

Statement 2: x = x.
This statement alone is insufficient to answer the question, as it only states that x is equal to itself, which does not provide any information about the actual value of x. Therefore, option (B) is incorrect.

Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question. Therefore, options (C) and (E) are incorrect.

When taken together, statements 1 and 2 do not provide additional information that would help answer the question. Therefore, option (D) is incorrect.

Hence, the correct option is (A): Statement 1 alone is sufficient.

[/INST]


Correct answer: D
 (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

To determine if our city has enough beds for patients, we need to know both the required number of beds per thousand people and the actual number of beds available per thousand people.

Statement 1 provides the required number of beds per thousand people, which is at least 100 beds.

Statement 2 provides the actual number of beds available per thousand people, which is 150 beds.

Taken together, statements 1 and 2 provide sufficient information to determine that our city has enough beds for patients, since the actual number of beds available per thousand people (150) exceeds the required number of beds per thousand people (100).

Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer.

1. Student X got 7 questions correct. 
2. Student X got all the questions correct.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
 (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Here's why:

Statement 1: Student X got 7 questions correct.
This statement alone is not sufficient to determine whether Student X passed the test, as we don't know how many questions were on the test or what the passing score is.

Statement 2: Student X got all the questions correct.
This statement alone is sufficient to determine that Student X passed the test, as it implies that Student X answered all the questions correctly and therefore scored 100%.

Taken together, Statements 1 and 2 provide enough information to determine that Student X passed the test. We know that Student X answered at least 7 questions correctly (Statement 1), and that they answered all the questions correctly (Statement 2). Therefore, Student X's score is at least 7/10, which is greater than the required 70% passing score.

So, option (D) is the correct answer.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
 The question asks whether circle A is smaller than circle B.

Statement 1: The area of circle B is two times the area of circle A.

This statement alone is sufficient to determine that circle A is smaller than circle B, since the area of circle B is twice the area of circle A. Therefore, option (A) is correct.

Statement 2: The radius of circle B is less than the radius of circle A.

This statement alone is not sufficient to determine whether circle A is smaller than circle B, since we need to know the actual values of the radii to compare the sizes of the circles. Therefore, option (B) is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct option is (A), Statement 1 alone is sufficient.

Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. You are allowed to pour water out of the cup into a measuring cylinder or any other container.
2. You are allowed to use a ruler or measuring tape.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (F) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(F). The question can be answered without either statement.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: F
The question is asking who is right, Neha or Vighnesh, in their assessment of the amount of water in the cup.

To answer this question, we need to determine the amount of water in the cup.

Statement 1: "You are allowed to pour water out of the cup into a measuring cylinder or any other container."
This statement alone is not sufficient to answer the question because it only allows us to pour water out of the cup, not measure the amount of water in the cup.

Statement 2: "You are allowed to use a ruler or measuring tape."
This statement alone is sufficient to answer the question because it allows us to measure the height of the water in the cup using a ruler or measuring tape. By measuring the height of the water, we can determine whether the cup is more than half full or at least half empty.

Therefore, the correct option is (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: B


<s>[INST]Can Bill afford to buy more $50 pots for his garden? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Bill's gardening budget is $300 and he has spent some of the budget. 
. Bill has only spent his budget on 7 plants that cost $40 each.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
 Answer: The correct option is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Explanation:
Statement 1 alone is insufficient because it only provides information about Bill's total gardening budget, but doesn't give any details about how much he has spent or what he has spent it on.
Statement 2 alone is insufficient because it only provides information about the number and cost of plants Bill has bought, but doesn't give any information about his overall gardening budget or how much he has spent.
Together, statements 1 and 2 provide enough information to calculate how much Bill has spent so far and how much he has left in his budget. From statement 1, we know that Bill's gardening budget is $300. From statement 2, we know that Bill has spent $40 per plant and has bought 7 plants, so he has spent a total of $280 ($40 x 7).
Now, we can calculate how much of his budget Bill has left by subtracting the amount he has spent from his total budget: $300 - $280 = $20.
Therefore, Bill can afford to buy more $50 pots for his garden because he has $20 left in his budget. Thus, option (D) is the correct answer.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
 (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Justin's sister's father's son is Tim. So, Tim is Justin's nephew.

Justin is Tim's brother's father-in-law's only daughter's brother-in-law. So, Tim's brother is married to Justin's sister, which makes Tim Justin's brother-in-law.

Therefore, Tim is both Justin's nephew and brother-in-law, so the correct option is (D).

<s>[INST]Is x a prime number? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. x is divisible by the factors of 10. 
2. x is greater than 13.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
 The question asks whether x is a prime number.

Statement 1: x is divisible by the factors of 10.

If x is divisible by the factors of 10, then it means that x is not prime because a prime number must be divisible only by 1 and itself. Therefore, statement 1 alone is sufficient to determine that x is not a prime number.

Statement 2: x is greater than 13.

If x is greater than 13, it does not necessarily mean that it is a prime number. There are many numbers greater than 13 that are not prime, such as 14, 15, 16, etc. Therefore, statement 2 alone is insufficient to determine whether x is a prime number.

Therefore, the correct option is (A): Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

[/INST]


Correct answer: E
 The question is asking for the number of people in Maria's office who read the newspaper.

Statement 1: Half the people in the office don't read the newspaper.
This statement alone is not sufficient to answer the question because it only provides information about the number of people who don't read the newspaper, not the number of people who do read it.

Statement 2: 10% of the people in Maria's office read the newspaper.
This statement alone is sufficient to answer the question because it provides a specific percentage of people who read the newspaper.

Therefore, the correct option is (B): Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

2. Rita is only taller than Kathy and Komal.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
 The question asks who is the third tallest among Rachel, Rahi, Kathy, Komal, and Rita.

Statement 1: Komal is neither the tallest nor the shortest.
This statement does not provide enough information to determine who the third tallest person is. It only tells us that Komal is not the tallest or the shortest, but it does not give any information about the heights of the other four people. Therefore, Statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Statement 2: Rita is only taller than Kathy and Komal.
This statement tells us that Rita is taller than Kathy and Komal, but it does not provide any information about the heights of Rachel and Rahi. Therefore, Statement 2 alone is insufficient.

When we combine Statements 1 and 2, we can conclude that the third tallest person is Rachel. The reasoning is as follows:

1. Komal is neither the tallest nor the shortest (Statement 1).
2. Rita is only taller than Kathy and Komal (Statement 2).
3. Therefore, Rita is not the tallest, since Komal is not the shortest.
4. Therefore, the tallest person is either Rachel or Rahi.
5. Since Rita is taller than Kathy and Komal, the third tallest person must be Rachel.

So, the correct answer is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
Given answer: D

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
 The question asks whether x is divisible by 2.

Statement 1: x is an even number.

An even number is always divisible by 2, so Statement 1 alone is sufficient to answer the question. Therefore, the answer is (A).

Statement 2: The square root of x is greater than 4.

The square root of x being greater than 4 implies that x is a positive number, but it doesn'流t necessarily mean that x is divisible by 2. For example, the square root of 9 is greater than 4, but 9 is not divisible by 2. Therefore, Statement 2 alone is not sufficient to answer the question.

Therefore, the correct option is (A): Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
 The correct option is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Explanation:

From statement 1, we know that five years ago, Qi's age was half of her current age. So, we can write an equation:
Qi's current age = 2 * (Qi's age five years ago)

From statement 2, we know that Qi will be 23 years old in 5 years. So, we can write another equation:
Qi's current age + 5 = 23

Now, we can solve the system of equations. Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
2 * (Qi's age five years ago) + 5 = 23

Simplifying, we get:
Qi's age five years ago = 11

So, Qi's current age = 2 * 11 = 22.

Therefore, Qi is currently 22 years old.

Answer: (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
 The correct answer is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient. 

Explanation:

Statement 1 states that Tony's birthday is after 16th and before 19th March. This means his birthday falls between 17th and 18th of March. 

Statement 2 states that Tony's birthday is on 20th March. This statement is incorrect, so we can rule out the option (B).

Since both statements are providing incorrect information, when combined, they give us a range of possible dates for Tony's birthday, specifically between 17th and 19th March, and we can narrow down the possible dates to 17th, 18th, and 19th. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
 (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

To determine the number of cows on the farm, we need to know that each cowshed contains one cow and the total number of cows on the farm. Statement 1 provides the information that each cowshed contains one cow, and Statement 2 provides the information that there are at least 60 cows on the farm. Therefore, by combining both statements, we can infer that there are at least 50 cows on the farm (since there are 50 cowsheds), and at most 60 cows (since there are at least 60 cows).

So, the correct answer is option (D).

Correct answer: F
 The question asks which outcome is more likely: Saina losing the first game or Saina losing the first game and winning the match.

Statement 1: Saina Nehwal has more physical stamina than P. V. Sindhu
This statement does not provide any information about Saina's performance in the match. Therefore, it is not sufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2: P. V. Sindhu is ranked higher as a badminton player than Saina Nehwal.
This statement suggests that P. V. Sindhu is the better player, and it is likely that she will win the match. Therefore, it is not sufficient to answer the question.

The correct option is (F), The question can be answered without either statement.
The correct answer is option (F), The question can be answered without either statement.
The question can be answered by considering the fact that Saina Nehwal and P. V. Sindhu are both professional badminton players with their own strengths and weaknesses. Without additional information, it is impossible to determine which outcome is more likely. Therefore, neither statement 1 nor statement 2 is sufficient to answer the question.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
 (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

To determine whether Alina wants to read "Under the Sun," we need to know two things:

1. Whether "Under the Sun" is an adventure book.
2. Whether Alina is only interested in adventure books.

Statement 1 alone is insufficient because it only tells us that the author of "Under the Sun" only writes adventure books, but it doesn' earn tell us whether "Under the Sun" itself is an adventure book.

Statement 2 alone is insufficient because it only tells us that Alina is only offered adventure and mystery books, but it doesn't tell us whether "Under the Sun" is an adventure book or a mystery book.

However, taken together, statements 1 and 2 provide sufficient information to answer the question. If the author of "Under the Sun" only writes adventure books, and Alina is only offered adventure and mystery books, then it's likely that "Under the Sun" is an adventure book. Therefore, Alina would be interested in reading it.

Therefore, the correct option is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
 The question being asked is which of the options is sufficient to answer whether Betty answered correctly or not. 

From statement (1) alone, we can tell that Betty answered False, but we don't know whether the actual answer is True or False, so statement (1) alone is insufficient.

From statement (2) alone, we know the test has 5 questions, but we don't know which question Betty got wrong or whether the answer she gave was True or False, so statement (2) alone is insufficient.

Taking both statements (1) and (2) together, we know Betty answered False and the test has 5 questions. Let's consider the possible scenarios:

Scenario 1: The question Betty answered False is actually True. In this case, the correct answer is True.
Scenario 2: The question Betty answered False is actually False. In this case, the correct answer is False.

Since we can determine the correct answer in both scenarios, statements (1) and (2) taken together are sufficient to answer the question. Therefore, the correct option is (D). 

The correct answer is (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
 (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

The question asks for the difference in marks obtained by S and V.

From statement 1, we know that the difference in marks obtained by T and U is 11, and U got the highest marks. This means that U got 11 more marks than T.

From statement 2, we know that the difference in marks obtained by S and T is 15, and the difference in marks obtained by U and V is 9. This means that S got 15 more marks than T, and V got 9 more marks than U.

Now, we can add the two statements together. S got 15 more marks than T, and U got 11 more marks than T. Therefore, S got 15 + 11 = 26 more marks than U.

So, the difference in marks obtained by S and V is 26.

Therefore, the correct option is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
 The question asks who G is sitting opposite to in a game of Monopoly involving four players E, F, G, H.

Statement 1: E is sitting to the right of H.
This statement doesn' slash t provide direct information about G's position. It only implies that H is sitting to the left of E. Therefore, Statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Statement 2: F is sitting opposite to H.
This statement implies that F is sitting to the right of H. Since H is sitting to the left of E (from statement 1), therefore, F is sitting opposite G. Thus, statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B): Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Statement 1: E is sitting to the right of H.

From this statement, we can deduce that E is sitting on the left of H. However, we don't know who is sitting on the right side of H. Therefore, this statement alone is insufficient to answer the question.

2. Statement 2: F is sitting opposite to H.

From this statement, we can deduce that F is sitting on the right side of H. Since H is sitting to the left of E (from statement 1), therefore, F is sitting opposite to G.

Now we have enough information to answer the question. Therefore, statement 2 alone is sufficient.

Since statement 2 alone is sufficient, the correct answer is (B).
Given answer: B

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
Hello! I' Лиanning to help you with this question. Let's break it down step by step.

The question asks, "How many ants in total are in this room?"

Statement 1: "Only black ants can be found indoors."
This statement doesn't help us answer the question because it only tells us that black ants can be found indoors, but it doesn't provide any information about the number of ants in the room. Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Statement 2: "There are seven red ants in this room."
This statement provides us with some information about the number of ants in the room. It tells us that there are seven red ants in the room. However, it doesn't tell us anything about the number of black ants in the room. Therefore, statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Now, let's consider both statements together:

Statement 1 and Statement 2: "Only black ants can be found indoors" and "There are seven red ants in this room."
When we combine both statements, we can infer that there are seven red ants in the room, and since only black ants can be found indoors, there must be zero black ants in the room. Therefore, the total number of ants in the room is seven.

So, the correct option is (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

<s>[INST]What time does the clock show? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. The hour hand is between 5 and 6.
2. The clock shows a quarter past five.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
 The correct option is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Here's why:

1. Statement 1: The hour hand is between 5 and 6.
This statement alone is not sufficient to determine the time because it only narrows down the possible times to a range of 12:05 to 12:59.
2. Statement 2: The clock shows a quarter past five.
This statement alone is sufficient to determine the time as 12:15.

Together, statements 1 and 2 provide a complete picture of the time. Statement 1 narrows down the possible times to a range of 12:05 to 12:59, while statement 2 pinpoints the exact time as 12:15. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer.
Given answer: D

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
 The question asks about the direction of P relative to Q.

Statement 1 tells us that Q is to the north of R, who is to the west of P. This means that Q is to the north-west of P.

Statement 2 tells us that P is to the north-west of S. This does not provide any information about the direction of Q relative to P.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A): Statement 1 alone is sufficient.
Given answer: A

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
 Statement 1 tells us that B has two brothers, Nishant and Arav. This statement alone is not sufficient to determine how A is related to B.

Statement 2 tells us that A's father is the brother of Arav's mother. This means Arav's mother and A's father are siblings, making A and Arav first cousins. This statement alone is sufficient to determine how A is related to B.

Therefore, the correct answer is option (B), Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
 (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

The correct answer is option (D).

Explanation:

Statement 1 alone is not sufficient because it does not provide any specific information about the departure time of the bus. It only states that buses usually depart on time, but it does not guarantee that the bus will depart on time today.

Statement 2 alone is not sufficient because it only provides the scheduled arrival time of the bus, which does not necessarily determine the departure time.

However, when we combine both statements, we can infer the departure time of the bus. If the bus is scheduled to arrive at 11:40 a.m. and buses usually depart on time, then it is likely that the bus left the previous stop at around 11:00 a.m. to arrive at 11:40 a.m. Therefore, statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to answer the question.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
 The question asks whether Ajay is the only son of Aparna. 

Statement 1 says that Aparna's brother has only one nephew. Because "nephew" refers to the son of one's sister or brother, this means that Aparna's brother has only one son. Since Ajay is a son of Aparna, it follows that Ajay is the only son of Aparna. So, statement 1 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2 says that Ruhi is Ajay's sister. This does not provide any information about whether Ajay is the only son of Aparna. It only tells us that Ruhi and Ajay have the same parents.

Therefore, the correct option is (A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: A


<s>[INST]How many students are sitting in a row facing the board? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Kavya, who is fifth from the left end, is ninth to the left of Aadesh who is seventh from the right end.
2. Jagrav is eighth to the right of Neerja, who is sixteenth from the right end and fifth from the left end.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
The question asks for the number of students sitting in a row facing the board.

Statement 1: Kavya, who is fifth from the left end, is ninth to the left of Aadesh who is seventh from the right end.

From this statement, we can conclude that Kavya is ninth from the left end, and Aadesh is seventh from the right end. Since Kavya is fifth from the left end, we can deduce that there are four students to the left of Kavya. Therefore, the total number of students in the row is 4 + 1 (Kavya) + 7 (Aadesh) = 12.

Statement 2: Jagrav is eighth to the right of Neerja, who is sixteenth from the right end and fifth from the left end.

From this statement, we can conclude that Neerja is fifth from the left end and sixteenth from the right end, which means there are 15 students to the right of Neerja. Therefore, the total number of students in the row is 15 + 1 (Neerja) + 8 (Jagrav) = 24.

Now, let's see if we can find the number of students in the row by combining the two statements:

From statement 1, we know that Kavya is ninth from the left end and Aadesh is seventh from the right end.

From statement 2, we know that Neerja is fifth from the left end and sixteenth from the right end.

By combining the two statements, we can find the number of students in the row. We know that Kavya is ninth from the left end, and Neerja is fifth from the left end, which means there are 9 - 5 = 4 students to the left of Kavya. Similarly, we know that Aadesh is seventh from the right end, and Neerja is sixteenth from the right end, which means there are 16 - 7 = 9 students to the right of Aadesh. Therefore, the total number of students in the row is 4 + 9 + 1 (Kavya) + 1 (Aadesh) + 9 = 24.

The correct answer is option (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

2. In the game, yellow is called white, red is called orange and green is called brown.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
 The question asks for the color of a fresh tomato in a game where the colors are mixed up.

Statement 1: In the game, blue is called green, white is called black, brown is called purple.

From this statement, we can deduce that:

* Blue is called green, so green is actually blue.
* White is called black, so black is actually white.
* Brown is called purple, so purple is actually brown.

Statement 2: In the game, yellow is called white, red is called orange, and green is called brown.

From this statement, we can deduce that:

* Yellow is called white, so white is actually yellow.
* Red is called orange, so orange is actually red.
* Green is called brown, so brown is actually green.

Now, let's consider the color of a fresh tomato:

If we apply the color substitutions from Statement 1, a fresh tomato would be:

* Red (actual color) -> Orange (called color)
* Green (actual color) -> Brown (called color)

So, in this game, a fresh tomato would be called brown.

However, if we apply the color substitutions from Statement 2, a fresh tomato would be:

* Red (actual color) -> Orange (called color)
* Green (actual color) -> White (called color)

So, in this game, a fresh tomato would be called white.

Since both statements can lead to different answers, and neither statement alone is sufficient to determine the correct answer, the correct option is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Answer: D

<s>[INST]Kubera, the wealthy king of the Yakshas, liked all things made of gold and silver. The king decided to gift every Yaksha family a spherical globe made of solid gold with a cylindrical silver rod passing through its center. His goldsmith told him that this would require a 6 cm long, perfectly cylindrical hole to be bored through each perfectly spherical golden globe in order to insert the silver piece. Only the gold surrounding the curved surface of the silver cylinder would be retained. Kubera wanted the silver rod to be inserted but he was worried that gold was going to have to be removed from each of the globes. The goldsmith assured him that there would still be a fair bit of gold still left after the drilling.
What was the remaining volume of the golden globe, after drilling, when it was ready to be inserted with the silver rod?
Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Each silver rod was perfectly aligned perfectly with the vertical axis of the globe.
2. The diameter of the silver rod was exactly 1.25 cm.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (F) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(F). The question can be answered without either statement.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: F
The question asks for the remaining volume of the golden globe after drilling, which means we need to find the volume of the gold that will be left after the silver rod is inserted.

Statement 1 alone is not sufficient because it only tells us that the silver rod is perfectly aligned with the vertical axis of the globe, but it doesn't give us any information about the diameter of the silver rod or the size of the hole that will be drilled.

Statement 2 alone is not sufficient because it only tells us the diameter of the silver rod, but it doesn't give us any information about the alignment of the silver rod or the size of the hole that will be drilled.

To find the remaining volume of the golden globe, we need to know both the diameter of the silver rod and the size of the hole that will be drilled. Therefore, option D, "Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient," is the correct answer.

So, the correct option is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

2. The book has 380 pages out of which three-fifths were read by Wednesday.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
 The answer is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

To determine the number of pages read on Thursday, we need to find out the total number of pages read and then subtract the number of pages read before Thursday.

Statement 1 tells us that 54 pages were read after lunch on Friday. Since we are asked about the pages read on Thursday, this information is not helpful.

Statement 2 states that three-fifths of the book's 380 pages were read by Wednesday. Let's assume that 'x' represents the number of pages read on Wednesday. So, we can write:

380/5 = x

We know that three-fifths of 380 pages were read by Wednesday, so:

380 - x = 380/5

x = 126

Now we know that 126 pages were read on Wednesday. Let's calculate the total number of pages read between Wednesday and Friday (including Thursday):

126 + 54 = 180

So, 180 pages were read between Wednesday and Friday. To find the number of pages read on Thursday, we need to subtract the number of pages read before Thursday:

180 - 126 = 54

Therefore, 54 pages were read on Thursday.

Since we needed both statements to find the answer, option (D) is the correct choice.

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
 The correct answer is option (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Explanation:

From statement 1, we know that Karan has one sister. Let's call the sister "S".

From statement 2, we know that Jhanvi has one brother. Let's call the brother "B".

Since Karan has one sister (S) and Jhanvi has one brother (B), it's possible that S = B. In other words, Karan's sister (S) and Jhanvi's brother (B) could be the same person.

Therefore, statements 1 and 2 taken together provide sufficient information to determine that Karan and Jhanvi have a sibling relationship. This means that option (D) is the correct answer.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
 The number of girls in a family of 4 children can be determined by analyzing the two statements provided.

Statement 1: Each girl has twice as many sisters as brothers.
This statement doesn't provide any concrete information about the number of girls in the family. It only establishes a ratio between the number of girls and boys, but we don't know the total number of children. Therefore, Statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Statement 2: The youngest child is a boy, and he has 3 sisters.
This statement gives us concrete information about the number of girls in the family. We know that the youngest child is a boy, and he has 3 sisters. So, we can deduce that there are 3 girls in the family. Therefore, Statement 2 alone is sufficient.

Therefore, the correct option is (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: B


<s>[INST]At the finals of the All India Logic competition, the announcer displays six words:  MOSS, DRAG, CULT, CHOP, TRIM, GUTS. Each of the 4 finalists, representing the 4 regional champions within India (North, South, East & West), is given an envelope. Each of those 4 envelopes bear one distinct letter from one of those six words. All those distinct letters in the three envelopes are chosen from the same word. The contestants are forbidden from disclosing the letter in their envelope to anybody else. Each contestant has to determine the chosen word from the list of six.
The announcer asks the Eastern contestant, Durga, whether she can deduce the word. She instantly replies, “Yes!” Without asking her to identify the word, the announcer now moves to the regional champion from the North, Lakshmi and asks her whether she can identify the word. She thinks for a few seconds and then breaks into a smile, “Yes, I know the word.”
What is the word?
Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1.After Lakshmi, the announcer now looks at the contestant from the West and asks, “Saraswati , what about you?” Within moments, she too breaks into a smile and nods, “I know the word!”
2. The last person to answer is Meenakshi. She says, “Now I also know the word.”

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
The question is asking us to determine the word that the four regional champions have been given in their envelopes. The information we have is that the four champions are Durga, Lakshmi, Saraswati, and Meenakshi, and that they have been given letters from the same word. We also know that Durga and Lakshmi have already identified the word, and that Saraswati and Meenakshi have not yet revealed their letters.

Let's consider each option:

A. Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

If we know that Lakshmi has identified the word, then we can infer that the word must be a word that contains the letter L. This is because Lakshmi is the Regional Champion from the North, and the letter L is present in the word "North." Therefore, statement 1 is sufficient to narrow down the possible choices to a single word.

However, statement 2 does not provide any additional information that helps us identify the word. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

The correct answer is A.

 The question asks which statement is more probable, and the options are:
(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(F) The question can be answered without either statement.

Let's simplify the question: Which of the following statements is more probable?
1. Vighnesh likes computer programming.
2. Vighnesh likes computer programming and playing video games.

From the given options, we know that:

Statement 1: Vighnesh likes computer programming.

Statement 2: Vighnesh likes computer programming and playing video games.

We need to determine which statement is more probable.

Let's analyze each option:

(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

This option says that statement 1 is enough to answer the question, but statement 2 alone is not enough. However, statement 2 provides additional information that Vighnesh likes playing video games. This does not necessarily mean that Vighnesh likes computer programming more or less. Therefore, this option is not the correct answer.

(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

This option says that statement 2 is enough to answer the question, but statement 1 alone is not enough. However, statement 2 does not provide information about Vighnesh's interest in computer programming specifically. Therefore, this option is also not the correct answer.

(C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

This option says that either statement 1 or statement 2 alone is enough to answer the question. Since we have already determined that statement 1 alone is not sufficient, it means that statement 2 is sufficient to answer the question. Therefore, this option is the correct answer.

(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

This option says that both statements together are sufficient to answer the question. Since statement 2 provides additional information, it reinforces the probability that Vighnesh likes computer programming. Therefore, this option is also correct.

(F) The question can be answered without either statement.

This option says that the question can be answered without any additional information. However, we know that statement 2 provides additional information that Vighnesh likes playing video games. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is option (C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient, since statement 2 provides additional information that increases the probability that Vighnesh likes computer programming, and both statements together are sufficient to answer the question.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
 The question asks whether A is heavier than B.

Statement 1: A is not lighter than C.
This statement does not provide any information about the comparison between A and B. It only tells us that A is not lighter than C, but it could still be heavier or equal in weight to C. Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2: D weighs the same as A and B is heavier than D.
This statement provides more information. We know that D weighs the same as A, and B is heavier than D. Therefore, B must be heavier than A.

So, the correct answer is option (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Step-by-step analysis:

1. Statement 1: A is not lighter than C.
	* Insufficient. Does not provide information about A vs. B.
2. Statement 2: D weighs the same as A and B is heavier than D.
	* Sufficient. Provides information that B is heavier than A.

<s>[INST]On which date of the month was Jayant born in December 2012? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Jayant's birthday is on an even date of the month.
2. The day of the month on which Jayant was born is a prime number.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
 statement 1 states that Jayant's birthday is on an even date of the month. This means that Jayant's birthday cannot be on an odd date of the month. Therefore, we can conclude that Jayant's birthday must be on either the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, 20th, 22nd, 24th, 26th, 28th or 30th of December.

Statement 2 states that the day of the month on which Jayant was born is a prime number. The prime numbers among the even dates of December are 2, 10, 18, 20, 22, and 28.

Therefore, if we combine both statements, we can conclude that Jayant's birthday must be on either the 2nd, 10th, 18th, 20th, 22nd or 28th of December. Thus, option D (statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient) is the correct answer.

Therefore, the correct option is (D).

<s>[INST]A water pump pumps water at a uniform rate. How long does it take to fill the tank? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. In half an hour, seven-twelfths of the tank is filled.
2. The pump is switched on at 9:00 a.m.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
 (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Let's analyze each statement individually and then determine why (D) is the correct answer.

1. In half an hour, seven-twelfths of the tank is filled.

This statement provides information about the rate at which the tank is filled. However, on its own, it doesn't provide enough information to determine how long it takes to fill the entire tank. For instance, if the tank isfilled at a rate of 7/12 per half an hour, it could take 2 hours to fill the entire tank (12/7 = 1 5/7), or it could take 4 hours (12/7 = 1 1/2). Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient.

2. The pump is switched on at 9:00 a.m.

This statement provides information about when the pump was turned on, but it doesn't provide any information about the rate at which the tank is filled. Therefore, statement 2 alone is also insufficient.

Now, let's consider both statements together:

If we know that seven-twelfths of the tank is filled in half an hour, and the pump is switched on at 9:00 a.m., we can determine the time it takes to fill the entire tank.

Let's assume the tank is filled at a rate of 7/12 per half hour. We know that the pump is turned on at 9:00 a.m., so we can start calculating from then.

* 9:00 a.m. (start time) + 1/2 hour (7/12 fill rate) = 9:30 a.m. (first half hour)
* 9:30 a.m. + 1/2 hour (7/12 fill rate) = 10:00 a.m. (second half hour)
* 10:00 a.m. + 1/2 hour (7/12 fill rate) = 10:30 a.m. (third half hour)

Continuing this pattern, we can calculate the time it takes to fill the entire tank:

* 10:30 a.m. + 1/2 hour (7/12 fill rate) = 11:00 a.m. (fourth half hour)
* 11:00 a.m. + 1/2 hour (7/12 fill rate) = 11:30 a.m. (fifth half hour)
* 11:30 a.m. + 1/2 hour (7/12 fill rate) = 12:00 p.m. (sixth half hour)

Therefore, it will take 6 half hours, or 3 hours, to fill the entire tank.

Since we've used both statements together to find the answer, the correct option is (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
Given answer: D


<s>[INST]How long was the CEO's speech? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. The CEO spoke 30 words per minute.
2. Had the CEO spoken 5 fewer words per minute her speech would have lasted 4 more minutes.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
 (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

To determine the CEO's speech length, we need to know either the number of words spoken or the speech's duration.

Statement 1 tells us the CEO spoke 30 words per minute, but it doesn's tell us how long the speech lasted. Therefore, statement 1 is insufficient.

Statement 2 tells us that had the CEO spoken 5 fewer words per minute, her speech would have lasted 4 more minutes. We can infer the speech's duration from this information.

Assume the CEO spoke for x minutes. Then, the number of words she spoke is 30x (since she spoke 30 words per minute).

Had she spoken 5 fewer words per minute (i.e., 25 words per minute), she would have spoken for (30x - 5x = 25x) minutes.

According to statement 2, her speech would have lasted 4 more minutes if she had spoken 5 fewer words per minute. So, we can set up the equation:

25x - 4 = 30x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 16

So, the CEO spoke for 16 minutes.

Therefore, both statements taken together are sufficient to determine the CEO's speech length. The correct answer is (D).

<s>[INST]How many daughters does Devi have? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. X's father has 3 children.
2. Y is X's sister and daughter of Devi.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
 The question asks how many daughters Devi has.

Statement 1 says X's father has three children. This means X has three siblings, but it doesn't tell us anything about Devi's children. Therefore, statement 1 is insufficient.

Statement 2 says Y is X's sister and daughter of Devi. This means Devi has at least one daughter, Y. It doesn't tell us if Devi has any other children. Therefore, statement 2 is also insufficient.

Together, statement 1 and statement 2 imply that Devi has at least one daughter (Y) and X's father has three children. It doesn't tell us if Devi has any other children. Thus, option (D), that statement 1 and statement 2 together are sufficient, is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct option is (E), that neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient, because we cannot ascertain how many daughters Devi has based on the given statements. 

Answer: E

<s>[INST]Among 5 friends - Anjali, Arun, Ritika, Vishwesh and Kartik, who is the tallest? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Anjali is taller than Arun and Kartik.
2. Arun is shorter than Ritika but taller than Vishwesh.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
 The correct option is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient. 

Here's why:

 Statement 1: Anjali is taller than Arun and Kartik.

From this statement, we can conclude that Anjali is the tallest among the three: Anjali, Arun, and Kartik. However, we cannot determine who among Ritika and Vishwesh is taller.

Statement 2: Arun is shorter than Ritika but taller than Vishwesh.

From this statement, we can conclude that Ritika is taller than Arun and Vishwesh. She could be the tallest among all five friends, but we cannot confirm it with this statement alone.

When we combine both statements, we can conclude that Anjali is the tallest among all five friends. It is because Anjali is taller than Arun, and Arun is shorter than Ritika, who is taller than Vishwesh. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer.
Given answer: D

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
 The correct option is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Here's why:

Statement 1: X's father is married to Z.

This statement alone is not sufficient to determine the relationship between X and Y. We don't know who Z is or how X and Y are related to Z.

Statement 2: Y is the daughter of Z, who has a son and daughter.

This statement alone is not sufficient to determine the relationship between X and Y. We don't know who X is or how X is related to Z.

But taken together, we can infer the following:

* X's father is married to Z (from statement 1).
* Z has a son and daughter (from statement 2).
* Y is the daughter of Z (from statement 2).

Therefore, we can conclude that X and Y are siblings, since they have the same father (X's father) and the same mother (Z).

So, the correct option is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
 option E, "Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient" is the correct answer.

The reason behind this is that:

1. Statement 1 - "A plays hockey" - doesn't give any information about who plays cricket.
2. Statement 2 - "C plays neither chess nor football" - doesn't give any information about who plays cricket.
3. Combining both statements doesn't give any definitive information regarding who plays cricket.

Hence, option E is the correct answer.

2. The hour and minute hands coincide every 63 minutes starting at noon.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
 The correct answer is option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

To see why, let's consider each statement separately and then together:

1. The clock shows 7:45 a.m.

This statement alone is not sufficient to determine how much the clock loses in a day, as it only gives us the current time and doesn't provide any information about the clock's accuracy or how much it loses over time.

2. The hour and minute hands coincide every 63 minutes starting at noon.

This statement alone is not sufficient to determine how much the clock loses in a day, as it only tells us about the clock's mechanism and doesn't provide any information about the clock's accuracy or how much it loses over time.

However, when we combine both statements, we can deduce the following information:

* The clock shows 7:45 a.m., which means it is currently 7:45 a.m. + x minutes, where x is the amount of time the clock has lost since midnight.
* The hour and minute hands coincide every 63 minutes starting at noon, which means the clock loses 63 minutes every 63 minutes, or 1 minute every 1 minute.

Therefore, the clock loses 1 minute every 1 minute, or 1440 minutes in a day (since there are 1440 minutes in a day).

So, the correct answer is option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
 (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Here's why:

Statement 1: There is one tabla instructor for each of the 52 classes held in this city.

This statement alone is not sufficient to answer the question because it doesn't provide any information about the number of tabla instructors.

Statement 2: Each tabla instructor teaches 5 students.

This statement alone is not sufficient to answer the question because it doesn't provide any information about the number of tabla instructors.

However, if we combine both statements, we can find the number of tabla instructors:

1. There is one tabla instructor for each of the 52 classes held in this city.
2. Each tabla instructor teaches 5 students.

From statement 1, we know that there are 52 classes held in the city. From statement 2, we know that each instructor teaches 5 students. Therefore, the total number of students taught in the city is 52 x 5 = 260.

Since there is one instructor for each class, the number of tabla instructors in the city is also 52.

Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer.

2. The nearby hospital has a small maternity ward while the one far away has a much larger maternity ward.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
 (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Here's why:

Statement 1 tells us that male births account for 50.9% of all births, while female births account for 49.1%. This information alone is not enough to determine the number of male and female births at each hospital.

Statement 2 tells us that the nearby hospital has a small maternity ward, while the far-away hospital has a larger maternity ward. This information alone is also not enough to determine the number of male and female births at each hospital.

However, if we combine the two statements, we can infer that the far-away hospital is likely to have more male births than the nearby hospital. This is because the far-away hospital has a larger maternity ward, which means it can accommodate more births. Additionally, since male births make up a slightly higher percentage of all births, it's likely that the far-away hospital will have a slightly higher percentage of male births than the nearby hospital.

Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer.

Correct answer: E
 Answer: The correct option is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Explanation:

Statement 1: C is B's spouse.

From this statement, we can conclude that C is B's spouse, but we cannot determine whether A is B's brother.

Statement 2: A is C's relative.

From this statement, we can conclude that A is related to C, but we cannot determine whether A is B's brother.

Combining both statements, we can conclude that A is C's relative and C is B's spouse. Therefore, A and B have a sibling-in-law relationship, making A B's brother.

Therefore, the correct option is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

<s>[INST]How many fans went to the stadium yesterday? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. In total, 2343 single-person tickets were bought.
2. The stadium can seat 2600 fans.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
 The question asks for the number of fans who went to the stadium yesterday.

 Statement 1 reveals the number of single-person tickets sold, which does not necessarily equal the number of unique individuals who went to the stadium. For example, some of those ticket holders may have brought friends or family members who did not buy tickets. Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient.

 Statement 2 mentions the maximum capacity of the stadium, which also does not directly provide the number of fans who went to the stadium. It only gives an upper limit on the number of people who could have gone to the stadium. Therefore, statement 2 alone is also insufficient.

 We need both statements to find an estimate of the number of fans who went to the stadium. We can use statement 1 to subtract the number of single-person tickets sold from the maximum capacity given in statement 2. This will give us an approximate number of fans who went to the stadium. So, the correct option is (D).

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
 Option D is the correct answer.

Here's why:

Statement 1: M is not younger than P and O is older than N.

This statement tells us that M and P are either the same age or M is older than P. It also tells us that O is older than N.

From this statement alone, we cannot determine how many friends are older than O because we don't know the age of M and P relative to each other. Hence, statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Statement 2: P is older than exactly two friends.

This statement tells us that P is older than two friends, but we don't know which friends those are. It's possible that the two friends P is older than are M and O, in which case N would be the only friend older than O. Or, it's possible that the two friends P is older than are M and N, in which case O would be the only friend older than O.

From this statement alone, we cannot determine how many friends are older than O because we don't know which friends P is older than. Hence, statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Combining the two statements, we can conclude that M and P are either the same age or M is older than P, and P is older than exactly two friends. This means that there are at most two friends older than O: M and P.

Therefore, the correct answer is Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

[/INST]


Correct answer: C
 Ravi's rank from the bottom can be determined by subtracting his rank from the top from the total number of ranks. The total number of ranks is 56, according to statement 1, but we don't know Ravi's rank from the top. As a result, statement 1 is insufficient.

Statement 2 reveals that Kumar ranks 10th but is 47th from the bottom. If we subtract 10 from 47, we get 37, which means Kumar is 37th from the top. Since Ravi's rank is 22, Ravi's rank from the bottom can be calculated by subtracting 37 from 56, which is 19.

Therefore, either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient to answer the question. As a result, the correct option is (C).

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
 Statement 1: Neither S nor T pairs with either Q or R.
This statement does not provide enough information to determine the pairs. We know that P doesn'Totalt pair with Q or R, but we don't know whether P pairs with S, T, or U. We also don't know whether S or T pair with each other.

Statement 2: Neither P nor Q pairs with either S or U.
This statement provides some information, but it's still not enough to determine the pairs. We know that P doesn't pair with S or U, and Q doesn't pair with S or U. But we still don't know whether Q pairs with R or whether S and T pair with each other.

Taken together, Statements 1 and 2 provide enough information to determine the pairs. We know that P doesn't pair with Q or R, and Q doesn't pair with S or U. We also know that neither S nor T pairs with either Q or R. Therefore, the only possible pairs are:

* P pairs with T
* Q pairs with R
* S pairs with U

So the correct option is (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
