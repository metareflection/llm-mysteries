Cole is on the varsity basketball team. Is Cole over 6 feet tall? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Cole is under 7 feet tall. 
2. Every player on Cole's varsity basketball team is above 6'1".

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: B
The correct option is (B).

Here is the reasoning:

Statement 1: Cole is under 7 feet tall.
This information only gives us the maximum height of Cole but does not provide his minimum height. Therefore, we cannot determine from this statement alone whether Cole is over 6 feet tall.

Statement 2: Every player on Cole's varsity basketball team is above 6'1".
This statement directly informs us that Cole, being a player on the varsity basketball team, is above 6 feet 1 inch tall, which means that he is indeed over 6 feet tall.

Therefore, statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question, while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: B


Does Alice like elephants more than zebras? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Elephants are Alice's favourite animals. 
2. Zebras are the animals that Alice likes the least.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: C
The correct option is (A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

If statement 1 is true and elephants are Alice's favorite animals, it implies that she likes elephants more than any other animals, including zebras. Thus, knowing this alone would suffice to say that Alice likes elephants more than zebras.

Statement 2, telling us that zebras are the animals that Alice likes the least, does not inform us about her preference for elephants specifically. Hence, it is insufficient on its own to determine if Alice likes elephants more than zebras.

Therefore, the correct option is:
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: A


All the students in a classroom wrote an exam. How many students are in the classroom? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Five students failed. 
2. One student was 29th from the top and 16th from the bottom.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: B
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Explanation:

1. Five students failed.
This statement only lets us know the number of students who failed, but it doesn't provide any information about the total number of students in the class.

2. One student was 29th from the top and 16th from the bottom.
This information can be used to calculate the total number of students. If one student is 29th from the top, it means there are 28 students above him/her. If the same student is also 16th from the bottom, this implies there are 15 students below him/her. The total number of students can be found by adding the students above, the student in question, and the students below:

28 (students above) + 1 (the student in question) + 15 (students below) = 44 students

Therefore, using statement 2 alone we can determine that there are 44 students in the class, making it sufficient to answer the question. Statement 1 does not provide sufficient information to answer the question about the total number of students.
Given answer: B


Which direction is Samuel facing in? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Samuel is not facing North. 
2. Samuel is facing the sun.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: E
Given the two statements, let us evaluate each one:

1. Samuel is not facing North.
This statement only tells us one direction Samuel is definitely not facing, but it doesn't specify where he is actually facing. There are still three other cardinal directions (East, South, West) he could be facing, plus all the variations in between. So, statement 1 alone is insufficient.

2. Samuel is facing the sun.
This statement could be sufficient if we know what time of day it is because the position of the sun changes throughout the day. However, the given statement does not provide information about the time of day, nor the hemisphere Samuel is in, which affects the sun's relative position in the sky. Without additional context about the time and location, we cannot determine a single direction from this statement alone. So statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Taken together:
Even if we use both statements together, without knowing the time of day and the hemisphere, we cannot determine which direction he is facing with certainty. The sun could be in the East in the morning, in the South (in the northern hemisphere) around noon, or in the West in the evening. Since he could be facing any direction except north (from statement 1), and we don't have enough information to pinpoint where the sun is (from statement 2), we still can't determine Samuel's exact direction.

The correct option is:
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
Given answer: E


Are there only blue balls in the basket? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. There are no red balls in the basket. 
2. The smallest ball in the basket is green.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: B
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Explanation:

1. Statement 1: "There are no red balls in the basket." This statement only eliminates the presence of red balls, but it doesn't provide any information about the presence or absence of other colored balls besides blue.

2. Statement 2: "The smallest ball in the basket is green." This statement indicates that at least one green ball is present in the basket, but it does not inform us about the color of any other balls in the basket.

Even when combining statement 1 and statement 2, all we know is that there are no red balls and that there is at least one green ball. However, neither statement rules out the presence of balls of other colors, nor do they confirm that all remaining balls are blue. Therefore, we cannot definitively answer the question, "Are there only blue balls in the basket?" with the provided statements.
Given answer: E


Does Leonid like carrots? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Leonid hates vegetables. 
. Leonid prefers carrots to leeks.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: A
To determine if Leonid likes carrots, we can examine each statement:

1. Leonid hates vegetables.
- This statement suggests that Leonid dislikes all vegetables. Assuming carrots are included in the category of vegetables, this statement would be sufficient to infer that Leonid does not like carrots.

2. Leonid prefers carrots to leeks.
- This statement only suggests a preference between two vegetables but does not clarify whether Leonid actually likes or dislikes carrots overall—it is only relative to leeks.

Since statement 1 alone is enough to conclude that Leonid does not like carrots, and statement 2 alone is not sufficient to conclude whether Leonid likes or dislikes carrots, the correct option would be:

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: A


What is the probability of event B occurring? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Probability of event A is 0.55. 
2. Probability of either A or B or both A and B happening is 0.65.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: E
Option (E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

To explain why, let's analyze both statements:

1. Probability of event A is 0.55. 
   This statement only gives us information about event A and provides no direct information about event B.

2. Probability of either A or B or both A and B happening is 0.65.
   This statement gives us the probability that one of the events A or B or both occur. Mathematically, this is expressed as P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B).

We need to find P(B), but even with the given information regarding the combined probability of A, B, or both A and B, we are not provided with enough information to solve for P(B) alone. We also do not know the intersection probability P(A ∩ B), which represents the probability that both A and B occur simultaneously. Without that piece of information, we cannot determine P(B) using the given statements.

Therefore, even when taking both statements together, we still do not have enough information to calculate the probability of event B. We would need additional data about the relationship between A and B—specifically, whether they are independent, mutually exclusive, or have some other defined relationship that could help compute P(B).

The correct answer is (E).
Given answer: E


Will the building contractor need a special license? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
. All buildings with more than 20 floors need a special license. 
 The building contractor wants to build a 30-storey building.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: D
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Explanation:

- Statement 1 provides the requirement for a special license based on the number of floors in a building.
- Statement 2 describes the contractor’s intent to build a 30-storey building.

On their own, each statement does not give enough information. Statement 1 gives the requirement, but doesn't tell us anything about the specific building in question. Statement 2 tells us about the specific building but doesn't provide information about the licensing requirements.

However, when we put the two statements together, we can determine the answer to the question. Since all buildings with more than 20 floors need a special license (Statement 1), and the building contractor wants to build a 30-storey building (Statement 2), we can conclude that the building contractor will need a special license to build it.
Given answer: D


A wall is built in 6 hours by 10 men. How long will it take for 5 brick-laying machines to build the wall? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. If 5 brick-laying machines work with 5 men the wall will be built in 7.5 hours. 
2. The brick-laying machines work twice as fast as the men.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: C
To determine how long it will take for 5 brick-laying machines to build the wall, we need to establish a relationship between the work done by the men and the work done by the machines.

Let's break down both statements before deciding which one(s) are necessary to find the solution.

1. If 5 brick-laying machines work with 5 men the wall will be built in 7.5 hours.
This statement gives us a combined work rate for 5 machines and 5 men, but it does not give us the individual work rates of the men or the machines.

2. The brick-laying machines work twice as fast as the men.
This statement provides a relative work rate between the machines and the men but does not give us specific details about the timing.

Let's look closer at what we can infer from each statement.

From statement 1, we can write:
(5 men + 5 machines) * 7.5 hours = 1 wall

From statement 2, we can write:
If machines work twice as fast as men, then 1 machine is equal to 2 men in terms of work rate.

Now, we need the exact time it would take for the 5 machines to build the wall without any participation of the men. Let's look at each statement for sufficiency:

Using only statement 1 we cannot calculate the time it takes for 5 machines to build the wall because the contribution of men and machines to the work is combined and cannot be separated without additional information.

Using only statement 2, we can infer the following:
The original 10 men build the wall in 6 hours.
If each machine works twice as fast as a man, then:
5 machines = 5 * 2 men = 10 men.

We can apply a direct proportion - since 10 men build the wall in 6 hours, it is implied that 5 machines (being equivalent to 10 men) will also build the wall in 6 hours.

Using statement 2 alone, we can determine that it will take 5 brick-laying machines 6 hours to build the wall. 

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: B


What is the number of people in Ramya's restaurant? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. The number of people in Abhinav's restaurant is at least 10 less than the number of people in Ramya's restaurant. 
2. The sum of the number of people in Ramya's restaurant and Abhinav's restaurant is equal to 70.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: E
To determine the number of people in Ramya's restaurant, we need to evaluate the sufficiency of each statement provided.

1. The number of people in Abhinav's restaurant is at least 10 less than the number of people in Ramya's restaurant.

Statement 1 alone tells us there is a difference of a minimum of 10 people between the two restaurants. But without a specific number to reference, this statement alone does not provide enough information to determine the exact number of people in Ramya's restaurant.

2. The sum of the number of people in Ramya's restaurant and Abhinav's restaurant is equal to 70.

Statement 2 provides us with a concrete total (70 people) but doesn't provide a breakdown of how many people are in each restaurant. So, statement 2 alone is insufficient because the division of that sum between the two restaurants can vary in many ways.

However, when we consider both statements together:

- Statement 2 tells us the sum of people is 70.
- Statement 1 notes that Ramya's restaurant has at least 10 more people than Abhinav's.

We can set up the following equation using "R" for the number of people in Ramya's restaurant and "A" for the number of people in Abhinav's restaurant:

R + A = 70 (from statement 2)
R = A + 10 (or more, from statement 1)

Using these two equations, we can determine that R must be more than 35 (as it has at least 10 more people than A). The only way for R to be more than 35 and for the sum of R and A to equal 70, is for R to be between 40 and 60 people, and for A to be correspondingly between 30 and 10 people.

By taking the two statements together, we are able to determine a range for the number of people in Ramya's restaurant. As we do not have a single specific number but rather a range, some might argue that we don't have enough information to answer the question exactly. The question is asking for a specific number, and the statements combined do not give us an exact number but a range.

Since the initial question asks for the specific number of people and neither statement nor the combination of both provides an exact number, the correct option, given the typical interpretation of such questions, would be:

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient (to establish a range within which the number of people in Ramya's restaurant must fall).

However, if the question strictly requires an exact number, then we would have to consider:

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient (to determine the exact number of people).
Given answer: A


Who finished the task in the least amount of time between Liam, Pranav and Salma? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Liam takes as much time as Salma and Pranav would take if they worked together. 
2 Salma takes double the amount of time that Pranav and Liam take working together.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: A
To find out who completed the task in the least amount of time, we need to examine the information provided by the statements:

Statement 1: Liam takes as much time as Salma and Pranav would take if they worked together.

Let's translate this statement into an equation where L represents the time Liam takes, S represents the time Salma takes, and P represents the time Pranav takes.

L = S + P  (1)

Statement 2: Salma takes double the amount of time that Pranav and Liam take working together.

This can also be translated into an equation:

S = 2(L + P)  (2)

From Statement 1, we can't determine the individual times of Salma and Pranav, just that their combined time is equal to Liam's time. So, we cannot say who is the quickest by using statement 1 alone.

From Statement 2, Salma's time is double the combined time of Liam and Pranav. However, we don't know anything about the individual times of Liam and Pranav with this statement either.

To determine who did the task in the least amount of time, we need to know the individual times of at least two people and compare them.

Now, let's see if combining the statements helps:

Taking Statement 1 and Statement 2 together, we can substitute the value of L from Statement 1 into Statement 2's equation:

S = 2(S + P)

Now let's solve for S:

S = 2S + 2P

This translates to 0 = S + 2P

This equation makes no sense as it implies that Salma's time is negative, which is not possible in this context. 

There seems to be an error. Correcting this, the correct form should be:

S = 2(S + P)

S = 2S + 2P

S - 2S = 2P

-S = 2P

This equation implies that Salma takes negative time if Pranav's time is positive, which is not possible. We cannot deduce individual times using this equation. Hence, we made a mistake in the elimination process. Let's correct it:

Rewriting equation (2) again:

S = 2(L + P)

Now combine with equation (1) (L = S + P):

S = 2((S + P) + P)
S = 2S + 4P
S - 2S = 4P
-S = 4P
P = -S/4

Given that time can only be a positive value, this contradicts the real-world scenario we're trying to model. There's a clear mistake in my initial correction. We need to be very careful in our algebraic manipulations. Statements about combining times or speeds can be counterintuitive, and it’s easy to make algebraic mistakes.

When Salma is taking twice as long as Liam and Pranav together, it implies she is slower than either Liam or Pranav. Furthermore, Statement 1 implies that Liam and Pranav working together would take the same amount of time as Liam alone, which means Pranav does not add any time to the completion of the task when working with Liam. This means Pranav must complete the task in zero time, or in other words, he is infinitely fast.

Using both equations given by the statements, we can deduce that Pranav completed the task in the least amount of time because if he indeed required any time, the addition of his time to Liam's should have increased the total time taken by Liam, which it did not. Therefore, Pranav must be the fastest.

The correct option should therefore be (D) because both statements taken together are sufficient to answer the question.
Given answer: D


A family has 7 children. How many of the children are boys? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. There are fewer girls than boys. 
2. Each girl has half as many sisters as brothers.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: B
Let's analyze each statement.

Statement 1: "There are fewer girls than boys."
This statement implies the number of boys is more than the number of girls, but it does not give us a specific number. There could be 4 boys and 3 girls, 5 boys and 2 girls, or 6 boys and 1 girl. So this statement alone is insufficient.

Statement 2: "Each girl has half as many sisters as brothers."
Let's denote the number of girls by G and the number of boys by B. According to this statement, each girl has (G - 1) sisters and B brothers. Since each girl has half as many sisters as brothers, then:

G - 1 = 1/2 * B  =>  G = 1/2 * B + 1

Since there are 7 children in total (B + G = 7), we can substitute the expression for G into this equation to get the number of boys:

B + (1/2 * B + 1) = 7
1.5B + 1 = 7
1.5B = 6
B = 6 / 1.5
B = 4

So there are 4 boys and 7 - 4 = 3 girls. 

Statement 2 alone gives us the exact number of boys and girls, so it is sufficient.

The correct option is:

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: B


When is Qi's birthday? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Tony correctly states that Qi's birthday is after 2nd and before 5th March. 
2. Brenna incorrectly states that Qi's birthday is on 3rd March.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: D
Let's examine each statement:

1. Tony correctly states that Qi's birthday is after 2nd and before 5th March. This narrows down Qi's birthday to the following possible dates: 3rd or 4th of March.

2. Brenna incorrectly states that Qi's birthday is on 3rd March. Since Brenna's statement is incorrect, Qi's birthday cannot be on the 3rd of March.

Considering the information from statement 1, Qi's birthday could be on the 3rd or 4th of March. However, after reviewing statement 2, we now know that Qi's birthday cannot be on the 3rd, leaving us with one option, the 4th of March.

Therefore, we need both statements together to determine Qi's birthday. The correct option is:

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
Given answer: D


Is Alexia a doctor? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Either Alexia or Jenny is a doctor. 
2. Alexia and Jenny are a doctor and nurse respectively.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: B
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Explanation:

1. The first statement says "Either Alexia or Jenny is a doctor," but it does not tell us who exactly is the doctor. Therefore, statement 1 alone is not sufficient to determine if Alexia is a doctor.

2. The second statement clearly indicates "Alexia and Jenny are a doctor and nurse respectively." This means that Alexia is the doctor and Jenny is the nurse. Statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B).
Given answer: B


Will there be more crocodile attacks next year? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. There were more crocodile attacks this year than last year. 
2. 56 people were attacked by crocodiles this year.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: E
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

To accurately predict whether there will be more crocodile attacks next year, one would need additional context or information, such as changes in crocodile populations, habitat alterations, human-crocodile interaction trends, climate change effects, and conservation efforts. Simply knowing the number of attacks this year or the comparison with last year, without understanding the underlying causes or whether those conditions will persist or change, is not sufficient to make a reliable prediction about future attacks.
Given answer: E


Did African member states form the largest regional group in the United Nations in 1999? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. The United Nations Secretary General in 1999 was Kofi Annan, a Ghanian.
2. In 1998, the African regional group received the largest fraction of UN aid.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: E
E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Explanation:
To determine if African member states formed the largest regional group in the United Nations in 1999, we would need information about the number of member states from each geographical region that were part of the United Nations at that time.

Statement 1 mentions that the United Nations Secretary General in 1999 was Kofi Annan, who was from Ghana. However, the nationality of the Secretary General does not provide any information about the number of member states in the African regional group or whether it was the largest regional group.

Statement 2 indicates that in 1998, the African regional group received the largest fraction of UN aid. The amount of aid a regional group receives is not an indicator of the number of member states in that group, so this statement also doesn't provide the necessary information to answer the question.

Neither statement 1 nor statement 2, alone or together, provides information about the number of member states from each geographical region. Therefore, neither is sufficient to answer the original question.
Given answer: E


What is the value of x? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. x = 3. 
2. x = x.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: A
The correct option is (A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Explanation:

1. x = 3 directly provides the value of x, which is essential for answering the question. It is a definitive and specific statement.

2. x = x is an identity that is true for any value of x and does not provide any specific information about the value of x. It merely states that x is equal to itself, which is a fundamental property of equality in mathematics and does not tell us anything about the numerical value of x.

Therefore:

- Statement 1 alone is sufficient to determine the value of x.
- Statement 2 alone is not sufficient because it does not provide a specific value for x.
- Since statement 1 is sufficient, there is no need to combine it with statement 2.
Given answer: A


Does our city have enough beds for patients? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. A city needs at least 100 beds per thousand people. 
2. Our city has 150 beds per thousand people.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: D
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Explanation:
To determine whether the city has enough beds for patients, we need to know both the standard requirement and the actual number of beds available in the city.

- Statement 1 provides the minimum standard requirement, which is 100 beds per thousand people for a city.
- Statement 2 gives the actual number of beds available in our city, which is 150 beds per thousand people.

Taken together, these statements tell us that our city has more beds per thousand people (150 beds) than the minimum standard requirement (100 beds). Therefore, based on the information given, our city has enough beds for patients.
Given answer: D


A student needs to get at least 70% to pass the test. Does Student X pass the test? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Student X got 7 questions correct. 
2. Student X got all the questions correct.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: B
The correct option is (B).

Explanation:

Statement 1: Student X got 7 questions correct.
This statement does not provide information about how many questions were on the test. Without knowing the total number of questions, we cannot calculate the percentage of questions the student got correct, and therefore cannot determine whether the student passed the test.

Statement 2: Student X got all the questions correct.
This statement clearly indicates that Student X got 100% of the questions correct, as they answered every question correctly. Since 100% is greater than the required 70% to pass the test, this statement alone is sufficient to determine that Student X passed the test.

Since Statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question and Statement 1 alone is not, the correct option is (B).
Given answer: B


Is circle A smaller than circle B? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. The area of circle B is two times the area of circle A. 
2. The radius of circle B is less than the radius of circle A.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: C
Let's analyze the statements:

1. The area of circle B is two times the area of circle A.

If the area of circle B is two times larger than the area of circle A, this implies that circle B must be larger than circle A because area is a direct measure of size for figures of the same shape.

2. The radius of circle B is less than the radius of circle A.

This statement directly indicates that circle B is smaller than circle A because if the radius of circle B is less, then both its circumference and area will be smaller.

To determine if circle A is smaller than circle B:

- Using Statement 1, we know that circle B has a larger area, which means circle A must be smaller than B.
- Using Statement 2, we are told directly that circle B's radius is smaller, which implies circle B is smaller than A, leading to a contradiction.

In this context, since you are asking if circle A is smaller than circle B:

Statement 1 sufficiently answers the question by itself—circle A is indeed smaller than circle B, because B's area is twice that of A's.

Statement 2 contradicts the premise of the question; if the radius of circle B is less than the radius of circle A, then circle A cannot be smaller than circle B.

Therefore, the correct option is:

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: A


Neha looks at a cup of water and says “This cup is more than half full.” Vighnesh looks at it and says, “No, it’s at least half empty.” Who is right?
Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. You are allowed to pour water out of the cup into a measuring cylinder or any other container.
2. You are allowed to use a ruler or measuring tape.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (F) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(F). The question can be answered without either statement.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: F
The correct option is (C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Explanation:

- Statement 1 allows you to pour water out of the cup into a measuring cylinder or any other container. By doing this, if you find that the volume of the water is more than half the cup’s volume, you can conclude that Neha is correct: the cup is indeed more than half full. If it's exactly half or less, then Vighnesh is correct.

- Statement 2 allows you to use a ruler or measuring tape. If you can measure the height of the cup and the height of the water level, you can tell if the water is indeed more than half the height of the cup, which would make Neha correct, or half or less, which would make Vighnesh correct. 

Since you only need to use one of these methods to determine who is correct, either statement is sufficient to answer the question.
Given answer: C


Can Bill afford to buy more $50 pots for his garden? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Bill's gardening budget is $300 and he has spent some of the budget. 
. Bill has only spent his budget on 7 plants that cost $40 each.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: D
To determine whether Bill can afford to buy more $50 pots, we need to know how much money he has left from his gardening budget after his previous expenditures.

Let's evaluate each statement to see if either is sufficient to answer the question.

Statement 1: Bill's gardening budget is $300, and he has spent some of the budget.
- This statement tells us the total budget but does not provide specific information about how much Bill has already spent. Without knowing the specific amount spent, we cannot determine how much budget is left. Therefore, this statement alone is insufficient.

Statement 2: Bill has only spent his budget on 7 plants that cost $40 each.
- This statement gives us the exact amount that Bill has spent, which is 7 plants at $40 each. So Bill has spent 7 * $40 = $280 total on plants.
- Subtracting this amount from the total budget, we get $300 - $280 = $20 remaining.

Now that we know Bill has $20 left from his budget, we can answer the question. He cannot afford to buy more $50 pots because he only has $20 remaining, and each pot costs $50, which is more than the $20 he has left.

Thus, statement 2 alone is sufficient to determine that Bill cannot afford to buy more $50 pots.

The correct option is:
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: B


How is Tim related to Justin? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Justin's sister's father's son is Tim. 
2. Justin is Tim's brother's father-in-law's only daughter's brother-in-law.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: C
Let's analyze the statements:

1. Justin's sister's father's son is Tim.
   - This simply means that Tim is the brother or half-brother of Justin's sister and therefore is Justin's brother or half-brother (if they have the same father, it doesn't matter which sister is referred to, as her father would also be Justin's father).

2. Justin is Tim's brother's father-in-law's only daughter's brother-in-law.
   - Break it down step by step:
       - Justin is the brother-in-law of the only daughter of someone. To be someone's brother-in-law, he must be the spouse of the sibling of the only daughter (or the only daughter must be the spouse of Justin’s sibling which would not affect the relationship).
       - The only daughter referred to is the daughter of Tim's brother's father-in-law. This means the only daughter is married to Tim's brother. Since Justin is her brother-in-law, it means Justin must be Tim's brother, since the only way for Justin to be a brother-in-law to his brother's wife (the only daughter here) is for him to be a brother himself.

Since both statements independently lead us to the conclusion that Tim and Justin are brothers, either statement is sufficient to answer the question.

Therefore, the correct option is:
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
Given answer: C


Is x a prime number? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. x is divisible by the factors of 10. 
2. x is greater than 13.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: A
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Here's why: 

Statement 1: "x is divisible by the factors of 10."
The factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10. If x is divisible by these factors, it means that x is divisible by numbers other than 1 and itself. This property contravenes the definition of a prime number since a prime number can only be divided by 1 and itself without a remainder. Therefore, x cannot be a prime number if it is divisible by the factors of 10. Statement 1 alone is sufficient to answer the question that x is not a prime number.

Statement 2: "x is greater than 13."
Knowing that x is greater than 13 doesn't provide any information about its divisibility properties, so we cannot determine from this statement alone whether x is a prime number. There are both prime and composite numbers greater than 13. Thus, statement 2 is not sufficient by itself.

Since Statement 1 alone can determine that x is not a prime number, we do not need to consider Statement 2 at all for this determination.
Given answer: A


How many people in Maria's office read the newspaper? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Half the people in the office don't read the newspaper. 
2. 10% of the people in Maria's office read the newspaper.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: E
The correct option is (B).

To find the number of people who read the newspaper in Maria's office, you need to know two things: the total number of people in the office and the percentage of people who read the newspaper.

Statement 2 directly provides the percentage of people in the office who read the newspaper, with 10% of the people in Maria's office reading the newspaper. If you know the total number of people in the office, with this percentage, you can calculate the exact number of people who read the newspaper. Therefore, Statement 2 alone is sufficient.

Statement 1 tells you that half of the people in the office don't read the newspaper, which also means that half of them do read it. However, without knowing the total number of people in the office, you can't find out the exact number of people who read the newspaper just by knowing that half of the people read it. Hence, Statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Since you only need one of these pieces of information to answer the question (and Statement 2 gives a precise percentage), the correct answer is that Statement 2 alone is sufficient to determine how many people in Maria's office read the newspaper.
Given answer: B


Who is the third tallest among Rachel, Rahi, Kathy, Komal and Rita given that no two people are of the same height? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Komal is neither the tallest nor the shortest. 
2. Rita is only taller than Kathy and Komal.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: B
To determine the third tallest person, the statements need to establish an order of heights for all five individuals. Let's analyze the given statements:

1. Komal is neither the tallest nor the shortest.
This information alone does not place Komal definitively in the ranking, nor does it provide information about where the others stand. Thus, we cannot determine from this alone who the third tallest is.

2. Rita is only taller than Kathy and Komal.
This statement tells us that Rita is taller than Kathy and Komal, but shorter than the other two individuals (Rachel and Rahi). Therefore, the order from tallest to shortest must include either Rachel or Rahi at the top, followed by the other, then Rita, and then either Kathy or Komal at the bottom. The third tallest, in this case, is Rita.

Based solely on Statement 2, we know that the third tallest is Rita, which answers the question. Statement 1 does not give us enough information by itself to determine the third tallest person.

The correct answer is (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: B


Is x divisible by 2? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. x is an even number. 
3. The square root of x is greater than 4.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: A
The question asks if x is divisible by 2. Let's evaluate the given statements:

1. x is an even number.
By definition, an even number is divisible by 2. This statement alone is sufficient to determine that x is divisible by 2.

2. The square root of x is greater than 4.
This statement implies that x is greater than 16 (since the square of 4 is 16, and we want x to have a square root greater than 4). However, knowing that x is greater than 16 does not tell us if it is even or odd; both even and odd numbers can be larger than 16. Therefore, this statement alone is not sufficient to determine if x is divisible by 2.

The correct option is:
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: A


How old is Qi? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Five years ago, Qi's age was half of her current age. 
2. Qi will be 23 years old in 5 years.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: C
Let's analyze each of the statements:

1. Five years ago, Qi's age was half of her current age.
If we let Qi's current age be x, then five years ago, Qi was x - 5 years old. According to this statement:
x - 5 = 1/2 * x
To solve for x:
2*(x - 5) = x
2x - 10 = x
x = 10

So according to statement 1, Qi is currently 10 years old. This statement alone is sufficient to determine Qi's age.

2. Qi will be 23 years old in 5 years.
If Qi will be 23 in 5 years, then Qi's current age is 23 - 5 = 18 years old.

This statement also gives us Qi's exact age and is therefore sufficient on its own.

Since both statements independently give us Qi's age, the answer is:

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
Given answer: C


When is Tony's birthday? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Natasha correctly states that Tony's birthday is after 16th and before 19th March. 
2. Brenna incorrectly states that Tony's birthday is on 20th March.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: E
Let's analyze the given statements:

1. Natasha correctly states that Tony's birthday is after 16th and before 19th March.

From this statement, we know that Tony's birthday could be on the 17th or 18th of March.

2. Brenna incorrectly states that Tony's birthday is on 20th March.

From this statement, we know that Tony's birthday is not on the 20th March, but this alone doesn't provide us with any exact date for Tony's birthday.

Looking at both statements together, we know that Tony's birthday is not on the 20th, based on Brenna's incorrect statement, and we know it has to be between the 16th and 19th, excluding those dates, based on Natasha's correct statement. Taken together, we are left with two possible dates for Tony's birthday: the 17th or 18th of March. 

Given the information, we cannot determine the exact date of Tony's birthday, but it narrows it down to two possibilities when both statements are considered together.

Therefore, the correct option is:

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
Given answer: D


There are 50 cowsheds on a farm. How many cows live on the farm? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Each cowshed contains one cow. 
2. There are at least 60 cows.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: A
The correct option is (A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

This is because:

1. If each cowshed contains one cow, then we can directly answer the question of how many cows live on the farm by multiplying the number of cowsheds by the number of cows per cowshed: 50 cowsheds * 1 cow per cowshed = 50 cows. This statement gives us an exact number of cows on the farm.

2. The statement "There are at least 60 cows" gives us a lower bound on the number of cows, but it doesn't tell us the exact number. The actual number of cows could be any amount greater than or equal to 60, so by itself, this statement does not give us sufficient information to answer the question precisely.

Therefore, only statement 1 enables us to answer the question with the exact number of cows on the farm (50 cows), making it sufficient by itself. Statement 2, meanwhile, does not provide enough specificity to determine an exact count.
Given answer: A


Saina Nehwal and P. V. Sindhu are to play a best-of-three-games badminton match. Which of the following outcomes is more likely? 
1. Saina loses the first game.
2. Saina loses the first game and wins the match.
Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Saina Nehwal has more physical stamina than P. V. Sindhu
2. P V Sindhu is ranked higher as a badminton player than Saina Nehwal.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (F) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(F). The question can be answered without either statement.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: F
The question asks which outcome is more likely between Saina Nehwal losing the first game and Saina Nehwal losing the first game but winning the match. To determine which outcome is more likely, we need information about the players' relative abilities, their historical performance against each other, or some statistical trend in their matches.

Let's analyze the given statements:

1. Saina Nehwal has more physical stamina than P. V. Sindhu.
2. P V Sindhu is ranked higher as a badminton player than Saina Nehwal.

Neither statement gives a direct correlation to the likelihood of each outcome. While statement 1 might suggest Saina could recover and win following a loss in the first game due to her higher stamina, it does not directly address the likelihood of her losing that first game or winning subsequent games. 

Statement 2 indicates that Sindhu is ranked higher than Saina, which could suggest Sindhu is more likely to win the match or the first game, but still does not provide explicit information on the likelihood of the specified outcomes, especially since rankings do not always perfectly predict the results of individual matches.

Moreover, even if one player is ranked higher or has more stamina, those factors alone do not determine the specific outcomes of a game within a match. Badminton matches are influenced by many variables such as skill level, current form, psychological factors, and head-to-head history.

Therefore, neither statement is sufficient on its own to determine the more likely outcome. Taken together, they still do not provide enough information to make a definitive judgment about the likelihood of the two outcomes in question.

The correct answer is:
(F). The question cannot be answered with the provided statements.
Given answer: F


Are some PQRs also XYZs? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Some XYZs are ABCs. 
2. Some XYZs are PQRs.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: B
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Explanation:

To answer the question "Are some PQRs also XYZs?" we need a direct relationship between PQRs and XYZs.

Statement 1, "Some XYZs are ABCs," does not involve PQRs at all, so it doesn't provide us with any information about the relationship between PQRs and XYZs.

Statement 2, "Some XYZs are PQRs," directly answers the question. It tells us that there is indeed an overlap between the set of XYZs and the set of PQRs, meaning that some PQRs are also XYZs.

Therefore, statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question, and there is no need to consider statement 1.
Given answer: B


Alina wants to read an adventure book. She is given a book titled "Under the Sun". Will Alina want to read "Under the Sun"? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. The author of "Under the Sun" only writes adventure books. 
2. Alina is only offered adventure and mystery books and "Under the Sun" is not a mystery book.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: C
To determine if Alina will want to read "Under the Sun," based on her interest in adventure books, we need to know whether the book falls into that category.

Statement 1: The author of "Under the Sun" only writes adventure books. 
This statement is sufficient to conclude that "Under the Sun" is an adventure book; hence, Alina should want to read it since she wants to read an adventure book.

Statement 2: Alina is only offered adventure and mystery books and "Under the Sun" is not a mystery book.
This statement is also sufficient because if Alina is only offered adventure and mystery books, and "Under the Sun" is not a mystery book, then by process of elimination, "Under the Sun" must be an adventure book. Thus, Alina would want to read it.

Therefore, both statements are independently sufficient to answer whether Alina will want to read "Under the Sun."

The correct option is (C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
Given answer: C


Betty answered a question incorrectly on a True-or-False test. What is the correct answer? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Betty answered False. 
2. The test has 5 questions.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: A
The question is asking us to determine the correct answer to a True-or-False question that Betty answered incorrectly.

Let's consider the available statements:

1. Betty answered False.
2. The test has 5 questions.

Statement 1 tells us Betty's answer, but not the question itself. Since True-or-False questions only have two possible answers, if Betty answered False and was incorrect, then the correct answer must be True. Therefore, statement 1 alone is sufficient.

Statement 2 informs us about the number of questions on the test, which has no bearing on the correctness of an answer to any specific question. Knowing that the test has 5 questions does not help us determine the correct answer to the specific question Betty got wrong. Therefore, statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Given this analysis, the correct option is:
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: A


There are 4 students - S, T, U and V. What is the difference in the marks obtained by S and V? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. The difference in the marks obtained by T and U is eleven. U got the highest marks. 
2. The difference in the marks obtained by S and T is fifteen and the difference in the marks obtained by U and V is nine.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: D
We need to determine the sufficiency of the given statements to find the difference in the marks obtained by S and V. Let's analyze each statement individually.

Statement 1:
- The difference in the marks obtained by T and U is eleven. U got the highest marks.

This statement gives us the difference between T and U's marks but doesn't provide us with any information about the marks of either S or V, which are specific to the question. Therefore, we cannot deduce the difference in marks between S and V from this statement alone.

Statement 2:
- The difference in the marks obtained by S and T is fifteen, and the difference in the marks obtained by U and V is nine.

This statement gives us information about the difference in marks between S and T as well as the difference between U and V. However, without knowing the actual marks of any of the students or the order of their marks, we cannot determine the exact difference in marks between S and V.

We need to ascertain whether we can use the information from both statements together to find the answer.

Taken together:
- Since U got the highest marks (from statement 1) and we know the difference between U and V (from statement 2), we can establish a relationship between U's and V's marks. Let's say U's marks are X, then V's marks are X - 9.
- However, we don't know where S and T stand in relation to U or V, even though we know the difference in their marks. S could be the second-highest scoring student or the lowest, the same goes for T.

Even when combining both statements, we are unable to determine the order of S, T, and V relative to U's highest marks. We would need to know at least the specific marks of one student, or the ordering of all students' marks, to calculate the difference between S and V.

Option (E) is correct because neither statement one nor statement two nor both statements taken together provide sufficient information to answer the question.
Given answer: E


Who is G sitting opposite to in a game of Monopoly involving four players E, F, G, H? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. E is sitting to the right of H.
2. F is sitting opposite to H.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: B
The correct option is (D).

Here's the reasoning:

Statement 1: E is sitting to the right of H.
Statement 2: F is sitting opposite to H.

To determine who G is sitting opposite to, we need to know the seating arrangement of all four players around the Monopoly board. Let's examine each statement:

From Statement 1, we know that E is sitting to the right of H, but we don't have enough information to determine the exact positions of F and G. The players could be seated in following ways:

- H could be next to G, making G to the left of H. But G's position across the board is still unknown since we do not know where F is seated.
- H could be next to F as well, which would mean F is to the left of H and that would conflict with Statement 2.

Because there are multiple possibilities for G's position with respect to H, Statement 1 alone is not sufficient.

From Statement 2, we know that F is sitting opposite to H. However, without additional information, we don't know where E or G are seated relative to F or H. There are two possibilities for where G could sit:

- G could sit to the right of H and opposite E.
- G could sit to the left of H and opposite F.

This means we cannot determine who G is sitting opposite to just from Statement 2 alone.

Now let's consider both statements together:
- We know from Statement 1 that E is sitting to the right of H.
- We know from Statement 2 that F is sitting opposite to H.

If we combine these two facts, we have the following seating arrangement, moving clockwise around the board:

H, E, G, F.

In this arrangement:
- E is to the right of H (satisfying Statement 1).
- F is across from H (satisfying Statement 2).

Thus, with both statements combined, G is sitting opposite F. Therefore, both statements together are sufficient to answer the original question.
Given answer: D


Q is the brother of R. How is R related to Q? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. R is the niece of P.
2. S has one sister R.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: C
The question we want to answer is: How is R related to Q? We know that Q is the brother of R.

Option 1: R is the niece of P. If R is the niece of P, this implies that R is the child of P's sibling. This information tells us about R's relation to P, not specifically to Q. However, since R is the niece of P, it does imply that R is female. Since R is female and she is the sibling of Q, this means R is Q's sister. Therefore, statement 1 alone is sufficient to determine the relationship.

Option 2: S has one sister R. This information tells us that R is a female sibling of S, but it doesn't provide any information about R's relationship to Q. Therefore, statement 2 alone is insufficient to answer the question because we cannot confirm if S and Q are the same person or different people.

Based on the information given, the correct answer is:

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: A


How many ants in total are in this room? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Only black ants can be found indoors.
2. There are seven red ants in this room.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: E
Let's evaluate the provided statements:

(A). Statement 1: "Only black ants can be found indoors." - This statement implies that if you see any ants indoors, they must be black. However, it does not provide a specific count of the ants in the room. Therefore, this statement alone is insufficient.

(B). Statement 2: "There are seven red ants in this room." - Since the question asks for the total number of ants in the room and statement 2 specifies there are seven red ants, this statement seems to provide a direct count. However, this directly contradicts statement 1 because it mentions red ants indoors when statement 1 has declared only black ants can be found indoors. If we were to accept both statements as true, we would reach a contradiction, meaning either the premise that red ants are in the room is false or that red ants can indeed be found inside, which is inconsistent with statement 1.

Let's evaluate the options with this in mind:

(A). Incorrect.
(B). Incorrect.
(C). Incorrect.
(D). Incorrect, because the two statements contradict each other.
(E). Correct. Neither of the statements provides a reliable count of the total number of ants in the room when taken alone or together due to the contradiction between them.

The correct option is (E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
Given answer: A


What time does the clock show? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. The hour hand is between 5 and 6.
2. The clock shows a quarter past five.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: B
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Statement 2 explicitly tells us the time on the clock - "The clock shows a quarter past five." This means the time is 5:15.

Statement 1 tells us the position of the hour hand, which is between 5 and 6, but on its own, statement 1 does not provide the specific time because we don't know where the minute hand is positioned. However, since we already have the exact time from statement 2, statement 1 is not needed to determine the time on the clock.

Therefore, the correct option is (B).
Given answer: B


P is towards which direction of Q? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Q is to the north of R, who is to the west of P.
2. P is to the north-west of S.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: A
Let's analyze each statement to determine if we can figure out the direction of P relative to Q.

Statement 1: Q is to the north of R, who is to the west of P.
If Q is to the north of R and R is to the west of P, this means P is to the east of R and north and east of Q. Therefore, P is to the northeast of Q. This statement alone is sufficient to determine that P is to the northeast of Q.

Statement 2: P is to the north-west of S.
This statement talks about the position of P relative to S and does not provide any information about Q. Without knowing where Q is in relation to S, we cannot determine where P is in relation to Q using this statement alone.

Given that statement 1 is sufficient by itself to determine the direction of P relative to Q, the answer is:

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: A


How is A related to B? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. B has two brothers Nishant and Arav.
2. A's father is the brother of Arav's mother.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: D
Let's analyze the given statements:

1. B has two brothers Nishant and Arav.
This only tells us about B's siblings and doesn't provide any direct information about A's relationship to B; thus, it doesn't help in determining how A is related to B without additional context.

2. A's father is the brother of Arav's mother.
This tells us that A's father and Arav's mother are siblings. Therefore, A is a cousin to Arav. Without knowing B's relation to Arav directly, we can't determine A's relationship to B.

To know how A is related to B, we need to understand the relationship between B and Arav. If we combine both statements, we get:

- Statement 1: Arav is B's brother, which means B is either Nishant or Arav.
- Statement 2: A is the cousin of Arav.

Putting the information together from both statements, we can see that A is B's cousin because B is either Nishant or Arav, and A's father is the brother of B's mother (whether B is Nishant or Arav). Hence, both statements taken together are sufficient to determine how A is related to B.

The correct option is:
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
Given answer: D


What time does the bus leave for the airport today? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Buses usually depart on time.
2. The scheduled arrival is at 11:40 a.m.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: E
The correct option is (E).

Explanation:

Statement 1: "Buses usually depart on time." This statement implies that there is a set schedule that buses follow and they tend to adhere to it, but it gives no specific information about the time a bus leaves for the airport today.

Statement 2: "The scheduled arrival is at 11:40 a.m." This statement provides information about when the bus is scheduled to arrive at the airport, but it does not give any information about when the bus departs for the airport.

Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 provides the specific departure time of the bus for the airport today. Even when taken together, they do not provide enough information to determine the departure time, since we're not given any details about the duration of the trip or any other relevant scheduling details.

Therefore, the correct option is (E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
Given answer: E


Is Ajay the only son of Aparna? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Aparna's brother has only one nephew.
2. Ruhi is Ajay’s sister.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: A
To determine whether Ajay is the only son of Aparna, let's analyze each statement on its own and then together if needed:

1. Aparna's brother has only one nephew.
If Aparna's brother has only one nephew, and we assume that Aparna's child Ajay is that nephew, then it is implied that Aparna does not have another son because that would lead to Aparna's brother having more than one nephew. However, this statement does not explicitly account for a situation where Aparna could have sons from different fathers, which would not all be the nephews of Aparna's brother if the brothers are only on one side. For this reason, we typically assume a traditional family structure in puzzles like this, which would imply Aparna cannot have more than one son. Therefore, this statement alone suffices to answer the question that Ajay is indeed the only son. 

2. Ruhi is Ajay’s sister.
This statement clarifies that Ajay has a sister, but it does not indicate whether Ajay is the only son or if there could be other sons as well. Therefore, it is insufficient to answer the question.

Based on the analysis:

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: A


How many students are sitting in a row facing the board? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Kavya, who is fifth from the left end, is ninth to the left of Aadesh who is seventh from the right end.
2. Jagrav is eighth to the right of Neerja, who is sixteenth from the right end and fifth from the left end.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: C
Let's analyze each statement to see if we can find the number of students sitting in a row facing the board:

**Statement 1**: Kavya, who is fifth from the left end, is ninth to the left of Aadesh who is seventh from the right end.

This implies that there are 4 students to the left of Kavya and 8 students between Kavya and Aadesh. Since Aadesh is seventh from the right end, there are 6 students to the right of Aadesh.

So, the total number of students = 4 (to the left of Kavya) + 1 (Kavya herself) + 8 (between Kavya and Aadesh) + 1 (Aadesh) + 6 (to the right of Aadesh)
= 20 students.

**Statement 2**: Jagrav is eighth to the right of Neerja, who is sixteenth from the right end and fifth from the left end.

This implies that there are 4 students to the left of Neerja and 15 students to her right (since she is sixteenth from the right end).

From the second part, we also know that Jagrav is eighth to the right of Neerja. This would mean that there are 7 students between Neerja and Jagrav. These 7 students plus Neerja herself would account for a part of the 15 students to the right of Neerja. However, we don't know the total number because Jagrav's position might not be at the end of the row, hence we can't determine the total number of students from this.

Therefore, we can't use Statement 2 alone to determine the total number of students.

Now let's consider the options:

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient. -- This is correct since Statement 1 gave us the total number of students.

Hence, the correct option is **(A)**.
Given answer: A


In a game, words for colours are mixed up. What is the colour of a fresh tomato in this game? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. In the game, blue is called green, white is called black, brown is called purple.
2. In the game, yellow is called white, red is called orange and green is called brown.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: B
The colour of a fresh tomato is commonly red. To figure out what red is called in the game, we need to find a statement that tells us what red is referred to as.

In Statement 1, red is not mentioned, so we cannot determine what red is called with this statement alone.

In Statement 2, it is mentioned that "red is called orange." This statement gives us the information we need to answer the question. Therefore, knowing what red is called is sufficient to know that a fresh tomato, which is red, would be called orange in the game.

The correct option is:

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: B


Kubera, the wealthy king of the Yakshas, liked all things made of gold and silver. The king decided to gift every Yaksha family a spherical globe made of solid gold with a cylindrical silver rod passing through its center. His goldsmith told him that this would require a 6 cm long, perfectly cylindrical hole to be bored through each perfectly spherical golden globe in order to insert the silver piece. Only the gold surrounding the curved surface of the silver cylinder would be retained. Kubera wanted the silver rod to be inserted but he was worried that gold was going to have to be removed from each of the globes. The goldsmith assured him that there would still be a fair bit of gold still left after the drilling.
What was the remaining volume of the golden globe, after drilling, when it was ready to be inserted with the silver rod?
Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Each silver rod was perfectly aligned perfectly with the vertical axis of the globe.
2. The diameter of the silver rod was exactly 1.25 cm.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (F) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(F). The question can be answered without either statement.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: F
To calculate the remaining volume of the golden globe after drilling, we need to know two things: the volume of the original gold globe before drilling, and the volume of material removed (in this case, the volume of the cylindrical hole that has been bored through the globe).

The volume of a sphere (before drilling) is given by the formula:

\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \]

However, we don't know the radius of the sphere from the information provided in the question.

The volume of a cylinder (the hole drilled through the sphere) is given by the formula:

\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]

Where \( h \) is the height (length) of the cylinder, and \( r \) is the radius of the cylinder (which would equal half the diameter).

From the information provided in the problem, we have the length of the cylindrical hole: \( h = 6 \) cm. However, we do not know the diameter (or radius) of the silver rod (i.e., the diameter of the hole).

Let's explore the sufficiency of each statement to answer the question:

1. Each silver rod was perfectly aligned with the vertical axis of the globe.
This statement provides information about the alignment of the rod but does not give us any information about the size of the globe or the diameter of the rod. Therefore, it is insufficient to find the remaining volume of the golden globe.

2. The diameter of the silver rod was exactly 1.25 cm.
This statement provides the diameter of the silver rod, which is essential for calculating the volume of the cylindrical hole through the globe. Knowing the diameter, we can find the radius (half of the diameter, so \( r = 0.625 \) cm), and then we can calculate the volume of the cylinder. 

However, without the original volume of the globe (which requires knowing the radius of the globe), we still cannot calculate the final volume of the golden globe after drilling.

Both statements taken together are insufficient because we still do not know the original radius of the golden globe. Without it, we cannot calculate the initial volume of the golden globe.

In conclusion, neither statement 1 nor statement 2 alone is sufficient, nor are both statements together sufficient. Additional information is needed, specifically the original radius of the golden globe, to determine the remaining volume of gold. Therefore, the correct option is:

(F). The question can be answered without either statement.
Given answer: F


How many pages of a history textbook were read on Thursday? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. The last 54 pages were read after lunch on Friday.
2. The book has 380 pages out of which three-fifths were read by Wednesday.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: D
The correct option is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient. Here's how we can deduce the answer:

Statement 1: The last 54 pages were read after lunch on Friday.
Statement 2: The book has 380 pages out of which three-fifths were read by Wednesday.

Let's analyze each statement separately:

Statement 1 alone doesn't give us any information about what happened on Thursday. We only know about the reading done after lunch on Friday. Hence, statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Statement 2 alone gives us information up to Wednesday. Three-fifths of 380 is (3/5) * 380 = 228 pages. So, by Wednesday, 228 pages of the textbook were read. However, this statement does not give us any information about the number of pages read on Thursday. So, statement 2 alone is insufficient as well.

Taken together, statement 1 tells us that 54 pages are read after lunch on Friday. Assuming that those were the only pages read on Friday, we can then subtract those from the total, leaving 380 - 54 = 326 pages read by the end of Thursday. Since we know from statement 2 that 228 pages were read by the end of Wednesday, the difference between the number of pages read by Thursday and the number by Wednesday is 326 - 228 = 98 pages.

Therefore, 98 pages of the history textbook were read on Thursday, and we needed both statements to come to this conclusion. Thus the correct option is (D).
Given answer: D


How is Karan related to Jhanvi? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Karan said that he had one sister.
2. Jhanvi said that she had one brother.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: E
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Explanation:

Statement 1: Karan said that he had one sister.
This implies that Karan has a sister, but it does not confirm whether Jhanvi is that sister.

Statement 2: Jhanvi said that she had one brother.
This implies Jhanvi has a brother, but it does not confirm whether Karan is that brother.

However, when the information from both statements is combined, it confirms that Karan has one sister and Jhanvi has one brother. Given that each has only one sibling of the opposite sex and considering the question of how they are related, it can be concluded that Karan and Jhanvi are siblings. Karan is Jhanvi's brother, and Jhanvi is Karan's sister.
Given answer: D


How many girls are there in a family of 4 children? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Each girl has twice as many sisters as brothers.
2. The youngest child is a boy and he has 3 sisters.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: C
Let's analyze each statement:

1. Each girl has twice as many sisters as brothers.
This statement means that the number of sisters is double the number of brothers for any girl in the family.

Let's assume that there are G girls and B boys in the family. Since there are 4 children in total, we have G + B = 4. According to the statement, for any girl, the number of sisters would be G - 1 (because she wouldn't count herself), and the number of brothers would be B.

The statement translates to G - 1 = 2B. We now have two equations:
- G + B = 4
- G - 1 = 2B

Solving the two equations simultaneously, we get:
G - 1 = 2(4 - G) => G - 1 = 8 - 2G => 3G = 9 => G = 3

So, there are 3 girls and 1 boy in the family. Statement 1 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

2. The youngest child is a boy and he has 3 sisters.
This statement directly answers the question, indicating there are 3 girls. There is no need to do any additional calculations. Statement 2 alone is sufficient.

The correct option is (C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

At the finals of the All India Logic competition, the announcer displays six words:  MOSS, DRAG, CULT, CHOP, TRIM, GUTS. Each of the 4 finalists, representing the 4 regional champions within India (North, South, East & West), is given an envelope. Each of those 4 envelopes bear one distinct letter from one of those six words. All those distinct letters in the three envelopes are chosen from the same word. The contestants are forbidden from disclosing the letter in their envelope to anybody else. Each contestant has to determine the chosen word from the list of six.
The announcer asks the Eastern contestant, Durga, whether she can deduce the word. She instantly replies, “Yes!” Without asking her to identify the word, the announcer now moves to the regional champion from the North, Lakshmi and asks her whether she can identify the word. She thinks for a few seconds and then breaks into a smile, “Yes, I know the word.”
What is the word?
Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1.After Lakshmi, the announcer now looks at the contestant from the West and asks, “Saraswati , what about you?” Within moments, she too breaks into a smile and nods, “I know the word!”
2. The last person to answer is Meenakshi. She says, “Now I also know the word.”

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: D
The word can be deduced from the initial information given without needing additional statements 1 or 2, which means that the information of Saraswati and Meenakshi also independently deducing the word isn't necessary for us to solve the puzzle. Therefore, option (E) is incorrect because we can already answer the question.

Here's how we deduce the word:

When the announcer asks Durga (East) if she can identify the word, and she instantly replies "Yes," this means that Durga has a letter that only appears once across all six words. If Durga had a letter that appears in multiple words, she wouldn't have been able to identify the word instantly.

The letters that appear only once across all six words are: O (from MOSS), A (from DRAG), L (from CULT), P (from CHOP), U (from GUTS). However, if Durga had the letter O, she wouldn't be sure if the word was MOSS or CHOP. So we can exclude O as a possibility for Durga's letter.

Similarly, Lakshmi (North) also deduces the word after thinking for a few seconds. If Durga's letter is in the set {A, L, P, U}, Lakshmi could not identify the word immediately because more than one word contains these letters. But since Lakshmi could eventually conclude the word, it suggests that Durga's quick answer helped her eliminate possible words she may have been considering based on her letter.

A crucial point here is that the only letter that appears in a word that does not share any other letters with the rest of the words is the letter L from CULT. Remember, the list of single occurrence letters based on the first observation was {A, L, P, U}. None of the other letters in this set appear in a word that doesn't share any other letter with other words, except for the letter L in CULT (A is in DRAG and TRIM, P is in CHOP, U is in GUTS and CULT). Therefore, for Durga to know immediately, she must have the letter L. The only word not sharing any other letters with the rest of the words is CULT.

Since Durga has the unique letter L that identifies its word without ambiguity, and Lakshmi now also knows the word after Durga’s display of certainty, it implies Lakshmi's letter also helped her narrow down the word to CULT. 

Therefore, the word is CULT and based on the initial information alone we could answer the question. Thus, we do not need either statement 1 or statement 2 taken independently or together. The correct option is:

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
Given answer: E


Which of the following statements is more probable?
1. Vighnesh likes computer programming.
2. Vighnesh likes computer programming and playing video games. Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Vighnesh likes to relax by watching YouTube videos.
2. Vighnesh likes mathematics.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (F) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(F). The question can be answered without either statement.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: F
To determine which of the two initial statements is more probable, we can rely on the concept of conjunction fallacy. The conjunction fallacy occurs when it is assumed that specific conditions are more probable than a single general one. In probability theory, the probability of two events occurring together (in "conjunction") is always less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring alone.

Based on this principle:

1. "Vighnesh likes computer programming." is a single event.
2. "Vighnesh likes computer programming and playing video games." is a conjunction of two events.

The probability of the single event (Vighnesh likes computer programming) is more likely or equal to the probability of the conjunction of the two events (Vighnesh likes computer programming and playing video games). Therefore, without additional information, statement 1 is more probable than statement 2.

Let's evaluate the additional provided statements:

1. Vighnesh likes to relax by watching YouTube videos.
2. Vighnesh likes mathematics.

Now we assess if these statements impact the probability assessment:

Statement 1 tells us about another of Vighnesh's leisure activities but does not directly inform us about his interest in video games or computer programming.

Statement 2 suggests an affinity for a logical and structured activity (mathematics), which might correlate with an interest in computer programming, but again, it does not tell us anything about his interest in video games.

Neither statement definitely increases the likelihood of Vighnesh liking computer programming and playing video games over just liking computer programming. They are neither sufficient alone nor in conjunction to alter the basic application of conjunction fallacy that the single event (Vighnesh likes computer programming) is more probable than the conjunction (Vighnesh likes computer programming and playing video games).

The correct option reflecting this understanding is:
(F). The question can be answered without either statement.
Given answer: F


Is A heavier than B? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. A is not lighter than C.
2. D weighs the same as A and B is heavier than D.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: B
Let's evaluate the statements:

1. A is not lighter than C.
This statement alone doesn't tell us anything about A's weight relative to B, so it's insufficient.

2. D weighs the same as A and B is heavier than D.
This statement implies that A weighs the same as D and B is heavier than D. Because A and D have the same weight, it follows that B is also heavier than A. Thus, statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the original question: A is not heavier than B.

So, the correct option is (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: B


Akshay and Prachi developed their own code language. Which word in the code language means 'leaf'? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. 'apo fu qe nane' means 'mango leaf is long' and 'nane ko' means 'long stick'.
2. 'apo qe lans' means 'green mango leaf' and 'ka lans' means 'green book'.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: E
To determine which word means 'leaf', let's analyze the provided statements:

Statement 1: 'apo fu qe nane' means 'mango leaf is long' and 'nane ko' means 'long stick'.
- We can deduce that 'nane' means 'long' because it appears in both phrases associated with the English term 'long'.
- However, we cannot uniquely identify the word for 'leaf' because 'apo', 'fu', and 'qe' are all possible candidates, and there's no additional information to distinguish among them.

Statement 2: 'apo qe lans' means 'green mango leaf' and 'ka lans' means 'green book'.
- We can deduce that 'lans' means 'green' since it is presented in conjunction with 'green' in both phrases.
- We can also deduce that 'apo' means 'mango' because it is the common word in both phrases that include 'mango'.
- Therefore, the remaining word 'qe' must mean 'leaf'.

From Statement 2 alone, we can determine that 'qe' means 'leaf' as we were able to assign meanings to the other words ('apo' for 'mango' and 'lans' for 'green') leaving 'qe' as the only word for 'leaf'.

Statement 1 is insufficient alone, but Statement 2 is sufficient alone.

The correct option is:

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: B


On which date of the month was Jayant born in December 2012? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Jayant's birthday is on an even date of the month.
2. The day of the month on which Jayant was born is a prime number.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: D
Let's analyze the statements one by one:

1. Jayant's birthday is on an even date of the month.
December has 31 days, so the even dates are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30. This information alone does not pinpoint a single date.

2. The day of the month on which Jayant was born is a prime number.
The prime numbers in December (1-31) are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and 31. This information alone also does not give us a single specific date.

If we combine both statements:
The even dates that are also prime numbers in December are 2. There is only one even prime number in this range, so by combining both pieces of information, we can determine the exact date of Jayant's birthday.

Hence, the correct option is:

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
Given answer: D


A water pump pumps water at a uniform rate. How long does it take to fill the tank? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. In half an hour, seven-twelfths of the tank is filled.
2. The pump is switched on at 9:00 a.m.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: A
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Explanation:

Statement 1 indicates that in 30 minutes, seven-twelfths of the tank is filled. Since it's given that the water is pumped at a uniform rate, we can calculate the total time it takes to fill the tank by setting up a proportion. We find that if seven-twelfths is filled in half an hour, then the whole tank (twelve-twelfths) would be filled in:

\( \frac{12}{7} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ hour} = \frac{6}{7} \text{ hour} = \frac{6}{7} \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 51\frac{3}{7} \text{ minutes}. \)

This means that statement 1 is sufficient to determine the time it takes to fill the tank.

Statement 2 simply provides a start time but does not offer any information about the rate at which the tank is being filled or the size of the tank. Without that information, it is impossible to determine how long it will take to fill the tank.

Therefore, the correct option is (A), as statement 1 is sufficient on its own to answer the question, while statement 2 is not.
Given answer: A


How long was the CEO's speech? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. The CEO spoke 30 words per minute.
2. Had the CEO spoken 5 fewer words per minute her speech would have lasted 4 more minutes.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: D
To find out how long the CEO's speech was, we need to know two things:

- The rate at which the CEO spoke (words per minute)
- The total number of words in the speech

Statement 1 tells us the rate (30 words per minute), but it doesn't tell us how many words were spoken in total, so we cannot determine the length of the speech with this information alone.

Statement 2 tells us that if the CEO had spoken 5 words per minute less (so 25 words per minute), the speech would have lasted 4 more minutes. This statement by itself is also not sufficient since we do not know the original length of the speech or the total number of words.

Now, let's analyze if we can use both statements together to determine the speech's length:

Let t be the actual time it took for the speech and W be the total number of words in the speech.

From statement 1:
Rate = 30 words/minute
We can write this as:
W = 30t

From statement 2:
Had the CEO spoken at a rate of 30 - 5 = 25 words/minute, the speech would be 4 minutes longer.
W = 25(t + 4)

Now we have a system of equations:
W = 30t
W = 25(t + 4)

Because W is equal in both equations, set them equal to each other:
30t = 25(t + 4)

Now let's solve for t:
30t = 25t + 100
30t - 25t = 100
5t = 100
t = 100 / 5
t = 20

Now that we have solved t, we can see that the actual speech length is 20 minutes when using both statements together. Hence, we have sufficient information to answer the question.

So, the correct option is:
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
Given answer: D


How many daughters does Devi have? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. X's father has 3 children.
2. Y is X's sister and daughter of Devi.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: E
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Explanation:
To determine how many daughters Devi has, we need to consider the information provided by both statements.

1. X's father has 3 children.
   This statement alone doesn't give us any information about Devi or the gender of the children, so we cannot determine how many daughters Devi has based on this statement alone.

2. Y is X's sister and daughter of Devi.
   This statement alone tells us that Y is a daughter of Devi but doesn't tell us anything about the number of daughters Devi has. We don't know if Devi has more than one daughter from this statement alone.

When we consider statements 1 and 2 together, we have additional information:

- From Statement 1, we know there are 3 children, and we can assume that X is one of them since X has a father.
- From Statement 2, we know that Y is a daughter of Devi and sister to X, which means she's one of the three children.
- Since Y is X's sister, it implies X cannot be a sister, otherwise, statement 2 would be redundant.
  
Thus, we can conclude that among the 3 children, there's at least one daughter, which is Y.

Since the question asks for how many daughters Devi has and we have identified Y as one daughter, and we know there are three children in total, none of the statements provides information about the gender of the third child or if Devi has any more daughters than just Y. There's a possibility the third child could also be Devi's daughter, and without information about the genders of X or the third child, we cannot determine the exact number of daughters Devi has.

Given the possible interpretations and the wording of the question, while it can be argued that the statements together do not give us an exact number since the genders of all three children are not explicitly stated, common interpretation would be that the statements together (X's father has 3 children, and Y is X’s sister and Devi’s daughter) are enough to come to a logical conclusion that Devi has at least one daughter, which is Y. However, without knowing the gender of the other two children, we cannot ascertain if there are more daughters.

Hence, the correct option based on the common understanding that we cannot ascertain the exact number of daughters is:
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

If the question intended to confirm that Devi has at least one daughter, then the answer could differ, but based on the information provided, we cannot determine the exact number of daughters.
Given answer: D


Among 5 friends - Anjali, Arun, Ritika, Vishwesh and Kartik, who is the tallest? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Anjali is taller than Arun and Kartik.
2. Arun is shorter than Ritika but taller than Vishwesh.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: E
Let's examine each statement independently and then together:

Statement 1: Anjali is taller than Arun and Kartik.
This only tells us the relative heights of Anjali compared to Arun and Kartik. We don't know if Anjali is taller or shorter than Ritika and Vishwesh.

Statement 2: Arun is shorter than Ritika but taller than Vishwesh.
This tells us the relative height of Arun compared to Ritika and Vishwesh. But we don't know how Anjali, Kartik, and Arun compare to Ritika, except that Arun is shorter than Ritika.

Taken together:
- Anjali is taller than Arun and Kartik.
- Arun is shorter than Ritika but taller than Vishwesh.

From these two statements, we can deduce the following height order:
- Ritika is taller than Arun (from statement 2).
- Arun is taller than Vishwesh (from statement 2).
- Anjali is taller than Arun and therefore taller than Vishwesh as well (from statement 1).

We still don't know how Anjali's height compares to Ritika's height, and we don't have any information about Kartik's height relative to Ritika and Vishwesh. Since we cannot establish a complete height order, we cannot conclusively determine who is the tallest among the five friends.

Thus, the correct option is:
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
Given answer: E


How is X related to Y? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. X's father is married to Z.
2. Y is the daughter of Z, who has a son and daughter.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: D
To determine how X is related to Y, let's examine the information provided by each statement:

1. X's father is married to Z.
   This tells us that Z is X's mother (or stepmother), but we are not given any explicit information about Y. Hence, we cannot determine the relationship to Y based solely on this statement.

2. Y is the daughter of Z, who has a son and daughter.
   This tells us that Y is Z's daughter. However, without knowing the relationship between X and Z or if X is the son mentioned, we can't establish the relationship between X and Y definitively.

Now let's consider both statements together:

1. X's father is married to Z.
2. Y is the daughter of Z, who has a son and daughter.

From statement 1, we know Z is X's parent (mother or stepmother). From statement 2, we know that Y is Z's daughter and that Z has a son and a daughter. Putting the two statements together, we realize that X must be the brother or half-brother to Y (as Y is the daughter of Z and X has the same father as Y).

With both pieces of information, we can determine the relationship: X and Y are siblings (brother and sister). Therefore, statements 1 and 2, when taken together, are sufficient to determine the relationship between X and Y.

The correct option is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
Given answer: D


Each of A, B, C and D play exactly one sport among football, cricket, hockey and chess. Who plays cricket? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. A plays hockey.
2. C plays neither chess nor football.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: D
Let's analyze both statements to determine which (if either) provides sufficient information to answer the question, "Who plays cricket?"

Statement 1: A plays hockey.
This statement only tells us what A plays. It gives us no information about the other three individuals and who plays cricket. Therefore, this statement alone is insufficient.

Statement 2: C plays neither chess nor football.
This statement narrows down the sports C could play to hockey or cricket, since cricket is one of the options we're trying to assign to one of the individuals. However, without further information about the other players, we cannot conclusively determine that C plays cricket because C could also be playing hockey. So, this statement alone is also insufficient.

Now let's consider both statements together:

1. A plays hockey.
2. C plays neither chess nor football.

Together, these statements tell us:

- A plays hockey.
- B's sport is unknown.
- C plays either hockey or cricket.
- D's sport is unknown.

Given that A plays hockey, we know that C does not play hockey (since each sport is played by exactly one person). This means that C must play cricket because it's the only other sport left from the options provided in statement 2.

Using both statements together, we have deduced that C plays cricket. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
Given answer: D


How much does a clock lose in a day? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. The clock shows 7:45 a.m.
2. The hour and minute hands coincide every 63 minutes starting at noon.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: B
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Explanation:

To answer the question of how much a clock loses in a day, we need to know how inaccurate the clock is, i.e., how much time it gains or loses over a standard time interval.

1. The clock shows 7:45 a.m. – This statement does not provide any information about the clock's accuracy or its rate of gain or loss over time. It simply states the time displayed by the clock at a particular moment.

2. The hour and minute hands coincide every 63 minutes starting at noon. – This statement tells us about the relative motion of the clock's hands, but it does not directly tell us anything about the clock's accuracy regarding the correct time. In an ideally accurate clock, the hour and minute hands should coincide every 65.454545... minutes (11/12 of an hour), as there are 12 hours on a clock face.

However, for this statement to be useful, we need additional information, such as how the 63 minutes compare to the ideal time for the hands to coincide. We can infer that the clock is running fast because the hands coincide more frequently than they should, but this statement alone does not tell us how much time the clock actually loses or gains over a 24-hour period without more information.

Since neither statement provides the necessary information to determine the rate at which the clock is losing time per day, combined they also fail to provide sufficient information. Thus, the correct answer is (E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
Given answer: E


How many tabla instructors teach in this city? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. There is one tabla instructor for each of the 52 classes held in this city
2. Each tabla instructor teaches 5 students.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: A
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Explanation:
Statement 1 states that there is one tabla instructor for each of the 52 classes held in this city. This directly answers the question of how many tabla instructors are teaching in the city because if each class has one unique instructor, there are 52 tabla instructors.

Statement 2 tells us that each tabla instructor teaches 5 students, but it doesn't provide any information about the total number of instructors. Without knowing how many total students there are or if instructors teach multiple classes, we cannot determine the number of instructors based on the number of students per instructor.

Therefore, statement 1 is sufficient by itself, and statement 2 is not sufficient on its own.
Given answer: A


There are two hospitals. One of them is near me while the other is far away. In which of the hospitals will there be more male births than female births? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. 50.9% of all babies born in a given year are male while 49.1% are female.
2. The nearby hospital has a small maternity ward while the one far away has a much larger maternity ward.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: D
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Explanation:
Statement 1 tells us the general statistics for the gender distribution of newborns, but it does not tell us anything about the occurrences at the specific hospitals in question. It simply provides us with the average figures across a whole population and doesn't indicate how these figures might apply to individual institutions, which can experience statistical fluctuations and deviations from the norm.

Statement 2 gives us information about the relative sizes of the maternity wards at the two hospitals. However, the size of the maternity ward doesn't directly correlate with the gender distribution of the births in either hospital. A larger ward may have more births in absolute numbers, but that does not mean the ratio of male to female births will be different from that in a smaller ward.

When the statements are combined, they still do not provide enough data to make a conclusive statement about which hospital will have more male births than female births. Although one hospital has a larger maternity ward and potentially more births overall, this does not affect the sex ratio of the births. Biological sex determination is a random process, and while the larger hospital might see more total births (and hence, in absolute numbers, possibly more male births), the proportion of male to female births should be expected to remain similar to the general statistics provided unless there is some other influencing factor that we're not informed about.

Therefore, without specific information about the actual birth ratios at each hospital, neither the general statistics (Statement 1) nor the size of the maternity wards (Statement 2) nor the combination of both can tell us which hospital will have more male births than female births.
Given answer: E


Is A B's brother? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. C is B's spouse.
2. A is C's relative.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: E
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Explanation:

1. Even if C is B's spouse, this does not tell us anything about A's relationship to B.

2. If A is C's relative, this could mean several things: A could be C's sibling, child, parent, cousin, etc. It does not definitively indicate that A is B's brother.

Even when combined, these statements do not provide enough information to determine if A is B's brother. For example, A could be B's sister-in-law (if A is C's sister), or A could be B's nephew (if A is C's sibling's son), among other possibilities.
Given answer: E


How many fans went to the stadium yesterday? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. In total, 2343 single-person tickets were bought.
2. The stadium can seat 2600 fans.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: A
The correct option to determine how many fans went to the stadium yesterday is:

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

This is because statement 1 gives us the exact number of single-person tickets bought, which presumably corresponds to the number of fans that attended. However, statement 2 only tells us the seating capacity of the stadium, not how many seats were actually filled during the event in question. Therefore, knowing the stadium's capacity does not provide us with the specific attendance figure. 

To answer the question of how many fans went to the stadium, we only need to know how many tickets were bought (or how many people actually entered the stadium, but in this case, we are assuming that the number of tickets sold translates directly to the number of attendees).
Given answer: A


There are 4 friends - M, N, O and P. How many friends are older than O? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. M is not younger than P and O is older than N.
2. P is older than exactly two friends.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: D
To find out how many friends are older than O, we must understand the relevance of the given statements.

Statement 1: M is not younger than P, and O is older than N.

- Since M is not younger than P, M can either be older than or the same age as P.
- O is older than N, so in the sequence N < O.

This does not tell us exactly how many friends are older than O, as we don't know the relative ages of M and P to O. Statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Statement 2: P is older than exactly two friends.

This statement tells us that P is the third oldest among the four friends. This means that there is one person older than P and two people younger than P. Since O is among these four friends:

- If O is P, then there is one person older than O (as P is older than exactly two friends).
- If O isn't P, then P is older than O, which would be consistent with P being the third oldest.

Either way, P is not the youngest, so N must be younger than O with M being the oldest, making it that one friend (M) is older than O.

Statement 2 alone provides sufficient information to answer the question: one friend is older than O.

The correct option is:

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Ravi is ranked 22 from the top in a class. What is his rank from the bottom? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. The rank list ends with rank 56.
2. Kumar ranks 10th but is 47th from the bottom.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: C
To find Ravi's rank from the bottom, we would need to know the total number of students in the class. In essence, we need the bottom rank or the number of students to calculate Ravi's position from the bottom.

Looking at the statements:
1. The rank list ends with rank 56.
2. Kumar ranks 10th but is 47th from the bottom.

Statement 1 tells us the rank of the last student on the list, which is also the total number of students in the class (assuming there are no gaps in the ranking). If there are 56 students in the class, and Ravi is ranked 22nd from the top, that means there are 55 students behind the top student, and thus Ravi's rank from the bottom would be 55 - 22 + 1 = 34. Therefore, Ravi is the 34th from the bottom. Statement 1 is sufficient on its own.

Statement 2 tells us Kumar's rank from both the top and the bottom. However, since we don't know Ravi's relation to Kumar's rank and cannot derive the total number of students from this information alone, statement 2 is not sufficient.

The correct option is:
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: A


Socks P, Q, R, S, T and U form 3 pairs. P pairs with neither Q nor R. What are the pairs? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Neither S nor T pairs with either Q or R.
2. Neither P nor Q pairs with either S or U.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
The correct option is (

Correct answer: D
Let's first look at the information given:

- P pairs with neither Q nor R.

This means that the possible pairs involving P are:

- P with S
- P with T
- P with U

Assuming that each sock has to be paired with exactly one other sock (with no repetition), there would be three pairs total. 

Now let's evaluate the statements:

1. Neither S nor T pairs with either Q or R.

If neither S nor T pairs with Q or R, this leaves the following possibilities for S and T:

- S pairs with either P or U
- T pairs with either P or U

Since we already know P does not pair with Q or R and now S and T also do not pair with Q or R, then by default, Q must pair with R. This leaves us with the following pairs:

- P pairs with either S or T or U (but we aren't yet sure which one)
- S pairs with either P or U
- T pairs with either P or U
- Q pairs with R

From statement 1 alone, we can derive that Q pairs with R, but we don't have enough information to determine the exact pairs for P, S, T, and U. So, statement 1 alone is insufficient.

2. Neither P nor Q pairs with either S or U.

Given the original information that P does not pair with Q or R, and S does not pair with Q according to statement 2, then by default:

- P must pair with T
- Q pairs with R (same reasoning as from statement 1; S and U cannot pair with Q, and P cannot pair with Q)
- This leaves S and U to pair with each other

Now we have all the pairs:

- P pairs with T
- Q pairs with R
- S pairs with U

So, statement 2 alone is sufficient.

The correct option would therefore be:

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
