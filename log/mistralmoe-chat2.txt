The culprit who stole the cannon is Captain Parker. The reason we know this is because John Webster realized that the ship was just as deep in the water as it was the day before, meaning that it had not unloaded the pig iron that Bob Turkle was expecting. This means that Captain Parker lied about unloading the pig iron and instead used the ship's oil-impregnated cloth to cover the cannon and pass it off as a stack of iron bricks. This is supported by the fact that Captain Parker is the only suspect who had access to the cannon and the ship, and he is also the only one who seemed to be in a hurry to leave after being delayed for three weeks. Additionally, the fact that Captain Parker is a giant and dressed all in black would make it easy for him to move around in the darkness without being noticed, and his all-black clothing would also help him blend in with the night..

1. We know that Andreas' lunch was stolen between 9:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m.
2. Beryl admitted to having a snack (half a pack of Camels) during that time frame, which eliminates her as a suspect for actually eating Andreas' lunch.

## 5minutemystery-the-necklace
<s>[INST]Who is the culprit based on this: 
The culprit is the maid. The clues that point to this are:

1. The maid is the only adult not allowed in the mother's room, reducing the number of suspects.
2. The footprint found near the cupboard is small, suggesting it belongs to someone of smaller stature, like the maid.
3. The strange print under the bed is likely from the maid's ladder or stool, which she uses to reach the high safe.
4. The fact that the maid is not allowed in the room suggests that she would have had to take the opportunity to steal the necklace when the mother was not around, such as when she retired early for the night.
5. The maid may have been bold and daring enough to take the risk of stealing the necklace, especially if she knew it was valuable and could be sold for a good price.
6. The parents may have been unaware of the maid'. Answer exactly one of Aunt Mary, Dad, Mom, Uncle Henry, Uncle John.[/INST]
