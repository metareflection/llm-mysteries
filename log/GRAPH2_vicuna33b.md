This could have been his motive for playing the prank, as a way of getting back at his parents for making him do chores while they got to relax.\n\nOpportunity: Rory had the opportunity to play the prank while he was in the kitchen alone, cleaning the dishes. He could have easily placed the tape on the sprayer, knowing that his mother would be the one to suffer the consequences when she went to wash the dishes.\nExonerating evidence for Rory: \n\n1. No mean: Rory is a 10-year-old child who is playing outside, as per his routine when he picks the low card. There is no evidence to suggest that he harbors any ill will towards his mother.\n2. No motive: Rory has no reason to want to hurt his mother. In fact, the story suggests that he is a typical 10-year-old boy who is more interested in playing outside than in causing mischief in the house.\n3. No opportunity: Rory is outside playing when the prank with the faucet is pulled. He has no opportunity to tamper with the faucet, as he is not present in the kitchen when the incident occurs.\n\nWho is the culprit?', ['Dad', 'Randy', 'Roger', 'Rory'])
Roger

They were Rachel Smithson, whose mother Karla had volunteered to help a very grateful Karen, Justin Bates, a classmate of Rachel’s, Karen’s daughter Lizzie, Lizzie’s best friend Anna Laughlin and Cole Bryant, who was also the Sheldon’s next door neighbor.\n\nThe Easter egg hunt was\nExonerating evidence for Cole: \n\n1. No mean: Cole was focused on finding eggs in the evergreen shrubbery and didn't seem to be interested in the golden egg.\n2. No motive: Cole didn't know about the golden egg until after the hunt, so he had no reason to steal it.\n3. No opportunity: Cole stayed in the area of the evergreen shrubbery during the hunt, and Karen saw him there.

He has a good relationship with Karen and the other children in the group.\n2. No motive: Justin has no reason to steal the golden egg. He is not driven by greed or the desire to win at any cost. He is happy to participate in the hunt and enjoy the fun and camaraderie of the event.\n3. No opportunity: Justin was in the far right corner of the field for the entire hunt, focused on finding eggs in the sand pit. He did not have the opportunity to go to the oak tree in the far corner of the field and retrieve the golden egg.

I want you all to search the ship, top to bottom. And I want you to look for this.” He held up a small casket, its lock prised open and its interior empty and bare. “Anyone found with this casket or its contents will be marooned at the next landfall.

Nehemiah, being a servant, likely didn\'t have much money or possessions, making the allure of the necklace and its value hard to resist.\n\nFinally, as for means, Nehemiah had the knowledge and skills to break into the casket.

The parrot squawked, "Pretty Polly," and Fairfax asked, "Did you steal the necklace?" Nehemiah shook his head, and made a negative gesture with his hands.\n\nFairfax was about to let Nehemiah go when he noticed something on the tray the mute was carrying. It was a silver spoon, one of the captain\'s, and it was tarnished as if it had been recently used. Fairfax asked Nehemiah to hand it over, and when he did, the quartermaster examined it closely.

Opportunity: Skylar was the only one who appeared to be awake after the others fell asleep, providing him with the opportunity to set up the miniature tombstone and arrange the cognac and roses.\nExonerating evidence for Skylar: \n\n1. Skylar did not bring a backpack or blanket, only a small paper sack with a sandwich and drink.\n2. Skylar was dressed in a light pullover sport shirt and khaki shorts, unlike the others who wore black in honor of Poe.\n3.

Here, they could assume the mindset of their hero, Edgar Allan Poe, and swap ghost stories in the dark hours after sunset. The graveyard’s caretaker, old Farrell, allowed the young men to spend several evenings a year in the oldest part of the cemetery, far away from the newer portion and sporadic visitors. Tommy and his friends Stephen Cowan, Connor Hardison, Skylar Jordan and Anthony Beam had several causes for celebration on this first meeting night of the summer.

They shared a love of mystery and the macabre, and would swap ghost stories in the dark hours after sunset. The graveyard’s caretaker, old Farrell, allowed the young men to spend several evenings a year in the oldest part of the cemetery. On this first meeting night of the summer, they celebrated Edgar Allan Poe’s 200th birthday. Connor and Skylar were graduating from the city college, and they were acutely aware of the milestone. They had wished to hold this meeting on January 19, Poe’s birthday, but winter nights were too bitter to meet in the graveyard and it had been an exceptionally cool and rainy spring. They had agreed to wait until school was out bringing drier, warmer weather\nExonerating evidence for Tommy: \n\n1. No mean: Tommy is a fan of Edgar Allan Poe and has a deep respect for the author. He has organized several gatherings at the old graveyard to celebrate Poe\'s birthday with his friends. This behavior demonstrates his admiration for the author rather than any malicious intent.\n2. No motive: There is no clear motive for Tommy to harm his friends or disrupt their gathering. In fact, he is the one who organized the event and was excited to celebrate Poe\'s birthday with them. His actions throughout the story show his dedication to honoring the author, not causing harm to his friends.\n3. No opportunity: The story describes how the friends arrived at the graveyard one by one and how they all settled in for their gathering. There was no opportunity for Tommy to sneak away and tamper with the drinks without being noticed by the others.\n\nWho is the culprit?', ['Anthony', 'Connor', 'Skylar', 'Stephen', 'Tommy'])

This points to a non-human thief, as it's unlikely that a human would have the ability to remove the chicken without disturbing the dish.\n2. The terrier was in the room during the entire time the chicken was on the table, and it didn't show any signs of having eaten the chicken. This means that the terrier didn't steal the chicken, as it would have been impossible for it to eat the chicken without being noticed.\n3.

Mean: Zeke brought a pizza as a practical joke, but it ended up being eaten by Ed's dogs. He also laughed when the dogs ate the pizza, showing a lack of concern for Ed's feelings.\n2. Motive: Zeke wanted to prank Ed by bringing a pizza instead of a dessert, hoping to make Ed think he didn't care about his mother's cooking.\n3. Opportunity: Zeke had the opportunity to steal the chicken since he was the one who brought the pizza, and he was the one who went to the compost bin to throw away the pizza box. This gave him a chance to take the chicken without being noticed.\nExonerating evidence for Zeke: \n\n1. Zeke was outside with Ed and the dogs when the chicken was stolen.\n2. Zeke had his hands covered in cheese and grease from the pizza, making it difficult for him to steal the chicken without leaving evidence.\n3. Zeke was with Ed when they checked on the neighbor's cat, and they both washed their hands before coming back downstairs.\n4. The only thing missing is the chicken, and there's no evidence that Zeke had anything to do with its disappearance.\n\nWho is the culprit?", ['Ed', "Ed's mother", 'Ed’s Husky', 'Zeke'])
Ed's mother
Method 2: Found wrong culprit Ed's mother, not real culprit Ed

Additionally, the dumpster where the evidence was found was large and would have required some effort to climb into and search through, which suggests that Konrad did not have the opportunity to steal the food and dispose of the evidence in the dumpster.\n\nIncriminating evidence for Pete Stampkowski: \n\nI was sleeping the little sleep – napping – when a tall, blonde ankled into my office. “Well, my lunch was stolen again today!” he bleated, planting his slender hips on his slender hips, staring petulantly down at me. “Second time this week!” I pawed sand out of my eyes, cursing the casual office attire policy that allowed men to wear shorts at work. “What’d ya want me to do about it?” I gritted, shuffling some blank papers around on my desk like I was busy. “I expect you to find out who the thief is.

Pete Stampkowski was at the Weiner Hut on Broadway having lunch with Larry Kolger of LK Industries from 11:45 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.\n2. Beryl Hives was at her reception desk out front and did not have access to the break room.\n3. Dawn de Jong was on a walking lunch and did not have access to the break room.\n4. Konrad Pushkin was at his desk in the accounts receivable department and did not have access to the break room.\n5. The brown paper bag with the remains of the apple, orange peels, and the empty milk chocolate bar wrapper was found in the dumpster outside.\n\nThese pieces of evidence, when combined, point to the fact that Pete Stampkowski did not have the opportunity to steal the food from\n\nWho is the culprit?", ['Beryl Hives', 'Dawn de Jong', 'Konrad Pushkin', 'Pete Stampkowski'])

Frank’s shrewd brown eyes looked over all four as they settled down onto the two bench seats that faced one another inside the stagecoach. The cowboy was short and squat, bowlegged, with a sunburnt face and neck and an amiable twinkle in his sky-blue eyes. The sheriff was large and bulky with a bushy grey mustache. He was wearing a white twenty-gallon hat and a pair of ivory-handled pistols. The lady was young and pretty, with bright red hair\n\nIncriminating evidence for The sheriff: \n\nThe sheriff had the means to cheat, as he was dealing most of the time. He had the opportunity to mark the cards, as he was handling them the most. As for motive, he could have been planning to cheat the other players out of their money, or he could have been working with the gunslinger to cheat them. The fact that he and the gunslinger won the larger pots suggests they might have been working together.\nExonerating evidence for The sheriff: \n\nThe sheriff in the story is not the cheater. There is no evidence to suggest that he had any motive, opportunity, or means to cheat in the card game. He was seated next to the lady, who won a large pot against him, and he did not appear to be manipulating the cards in any way. Additionally, the gunslinger and the cowboy were also involved in the game, and there was no indication that the sheriff was working in collusion with them. Frank Clairmont, the security officer, observed the game and did not detect any signs of cheating on the part of the sheriff.\n\nWho is the culprit?', ['The cowboy', 'The gunslinger', 'The lady', 'The sheriff'])
The sheriff

He had been released on parole a year ago and had been living with his mother in a small house not far from Eleanor Hall's home. Todd was known to be violent and dangerous, and the police considered him a potential threat to the community. However, there was no evidence to link him to the series of burglaries that had plagued the neighborhood.\n\nOne evening, as Todd was sitting in his room, his mother knocked on his door and asked him to come downstairs for a moment.

Her body was failing but with the assistance of her beloved grandson Nick and his wife Nance, she was able to live in the house she and her late husband Harry had purchased in 1946, shortly after the war ended. Eleanor pondered this one morning while sipping her morning coffee. Sadly, the neighborhood had deteriorated in the last few years. Not too long ago, it was well maintained and the neighbors quiet and friendly. But, in the last dozen years or so, Eleanor had seen the last of her old friends pass away and a new criminal element move in. Now, drug abuse and other crime, mostly thievery, had made the street she lived on unsafe. This was especially true for a 96-year-old widow, but Nick had been unable to convince her to move into a retirement center.\nExonerating evidence for Zac Coulson: \nEleanor Hall would soon be 97 years old.

Eleanor's attention to detail and her focus on her friends would have made it easy for Fiona to commit the theft without being noticed.\nExonerating evidence for Fiona Duncan: \n\n1. No mean: Fiona Duncan is described as quiet and unassuming, and she has no history of stealing or any other dishonest behavior. She has no motive to steal the necklace, as she is already wearing her own diamond necklace and has a tasteful matching purse and jacket.\n2. No motive: Fiona has no reason to steal Eleanor's necklace. She is a guest in Eleanor's home and has no financial need or desire to take the necklace. Additionally, she is already wearing her own diamond necklace, which indicates she has no need for additional jewelry.\n3. No opportunity: Fiona is present in the apartment throughout the evening, and there is no opportunity for her to take the necklace without being noticed. She is with the other guests during the cocktail period, and she is in the hall\n\nIncriminating evidence for Harold Duncan: \n\n1. Mean: Harold Duncan had a history of financial troubles, and his wife Fiona had confided in Eleanor that they were in dire straits. Harold had been let go from his job as a senior executive at one of Eleanor's charitable organizations, and the Duncans were struggling to make ends meet. This could have provided Harold with the motivation to steal the diamond necklace.\n2. Motive: Financial desperation could have driven Harold to commit the theft. He was aware of Eleanor's wealth and the valuable necklace she planned to wear to the party. He may have seen this as an opportunity to alleviate his family's financial troubles.\n3. Opportunity: Harold was the first to arrive at the party, right at 5:30 p.m. He stayed close to Eleanor throughout the evening, which gave him ample opportunity to\nExonerating evidence for Harold Duncan: \n\n1. No mean: Harold is a retired senior executive who is close to Eleanor. He is one of her favorites and stays close to her all evening. There is no evidence to suggest that he would have any reason to steal the necklace.\n2. No motive: Harold has no financial motive to steal the necklace, as he is a retired executive with a presumably comfortable income. Additionally, he has a good relationship with Eleanor and would have no reason to jeopardize it by stealing from her.\n3. No opportunity: Harold is with Eleanor for most of the evening, and there are no instances where he is alone in the bedroom or has the opportunity to take the necklace. Furthermore, he is not the type of person who would be interested in stealing valuables, as he has no history of criminal behavior or financial difficulties.\n\nIncriminating evidence for Maurice Eades: \n\n1. Mean: Maurice Eades is a caterer who has served Eleanor Williams for many years. He is close to her family and has a deep respect for her. However, he has been feeling the pressure of her constant supervision during his work. This could be a motive for him to take the necklace, as a way to get back at her for making him feel uncomfortable.\n2. Motive: Maurice has been feeling stressed and annoyed by Eleanor's constant supervision during his work. He might have taken the necklace as a way to get back at her and to relieve his frustration.\n3. Opportunity: Maurice had the opportunity to take the necklace during the evening when he was serving dinner. He could have easily taken it while no one was looking, especially since everyone was focused on the painting Eleanor wanted to show off. Additionally, he had a chance to take it\nExonerating evidence for Maurice Eades: \n\n1. Maurice Eades had no mean motive: He was a longtime family friend and caterer who loved Eleanor Williams as family. He had never considered asking her to find another caterer because of her constant supervision, which indicated that he had a positive relationship with her.\n2. Maurice Eades had no opportunity: He was responsible for serving dinner, which meant he was constantly in and out of the kitchen. During the cocktail period, Colonel Barrow and Fiona Duncan both excused themselves to use the restroom, which was located near the closet where Eleanor had placed the necklace earlier. Additionally, Abby Grant had excused herself briefly during the group's time in the hallway to sneeze, but Eleanor couldn't recall where she had gone. With so many people moving in and out of different areas of the apartment, it's unlikely that Maurice had the opportunity to\n\nWho is the culprit?", ['Abby Grant', 'Colonel Barrow', 'Fiona Duncan', 'Harold Duncan', 'Maurice Eades'])

He had overheard the conversation between Farmer MacDougall and the stranger about giving up one of the turkeys for the Thanksgiving dinner. Beaker was upset by the idea and decided to take matters into his own wings. He wanted to prevent Farmer MacDougall from choosing any of the turkeys for the dinner. Beaker had the opportunity to move the rake as he was out in the yard when Farmer MacDougall was in the barn. He had the motive to protect his flock and prevent any of them from being chosen. However, Beaker is not a mean turkey. He only wanted to protect his flock and did not intend to hurt Farmer MacDougall. The evidence shows that Beaker moved the rake, but it does not show that he intended to hurt Farmer MacDougall. Therefore\n\nIncriminating evidence for Beau: \n\nTurkeys have excellent hearing.

In fact, when the other turkeys found Farmer MacDougall with the rake on his chest, they immediately suspected that Beau was the one who tried to hurt him.\n\nOld Leatherneck, who was the oldest and wisest turkey in the flock, examined the scene and concluded that it was not an accident.

Rebecca blushed. “Looks like you’ve upset the balance of power around here,” Madge Anderson said, laughing. “Don’t worry about it, Rebecca. Isabelle’s had the lead in the last three productions.

Worked at the bakery with Isabelle, but didn\'t have a motive to sabotage her car.\nb. Received the part of Maggie "the Cat" Pollitt, which upset Isabelle, but no motive to sabotage her car.\nc. Arrived late to rehearsal due to car issues, but no motive to sabotage Isabelle\'s car.\n2. Madge Anderson:\na. Supportive of Rebecca getting the part of Maggie, no motive to sabotage Isabelle\'s car.\nb. Helped Rebecca learn her lines, no motive to sabotage Isabelle\'s car.\nc. Talked to Rebecca about the play and her part, no motive to sabotage Isabelle\'s car.\n3. James F\n\nIncriminating evidence for Madge Anderson: \n\n1. Mean: Madge has a motive to sabotage Rebecca\'s car because she is upset that Rebecca got the part of Maggie instead of Isabelle.\n2. Motive: Madge is friends with Isabelle and may have felt guilty that Isabelle didn\'t get the part, so she wanted to create problems for Rebecca to get her out of the play.\n3. Opportunity: Madge had the opportunity to disconnect the battery when she came to the clinic to visit Rebecca. She could have easily disconnected the battery while Rebecca was busy with a patient.\nExonerating evidence for Madge Anderson: \n\n1. Madge is a long-time member of the theater community and has a reputation for being kind and supportive.\n2. Madge has no known issues with Rebecca and has been encouraging her to succeed in the role of Maggie.\n3. Madge has a close relationship with the director, Alfred Cooper, and would have no reason to sabotage the production.\n4. Madge is not jealous of Rebecca\'s success, as she has a leading role in the play as well.\n5. Madge is not the type to engage in petty acts of sabotage, as she is well-respected and mature.\n\nThese pieces of evidence show that Madge has no motive, means, or opportunity to disconnect Rebecca\'s car battery, and therefore she should not be considered a suspect in the crime.\n\nWho is the culprit?', ['Alfred Cooper', 'Isabelle Rogers', 'James Fennimore', 'Madge Anderson'])
Isabelle Rogers

No mean: Mrs. Fairbank showed no signs of malice towards Mrs. Rhys. In fact, she was eager to resolve the situation quickly to minimize the negative impact on her social reputation.\n2. No motive: There was no apparent motive for Mrs. Fairbank to kill Mrs. Rhys. Mrs. Rhys had left a will naming each of the other guests as beneficiaries, which means she had no reason to harm Mrs. Fairbank.\n3.

Donna Blake had no motive to steal the chip because she had no personal grudge against the company and she had a good job with a stable income.\n3. There is no evidence of Donna Blake having any mean thoughts or feelings towards the company or George Wilson, and she was friendly and helpful during the investigation.\n\nBased on the information provided, Donna Blake is a potential suspect in the theft of the computer chip. However, further investigation and evidence would be needed to determine if she is guilty or not.\n\nIncriminating evidence for George Wilson: \n\n1. Mean: George Wilson had a strong motive to steal the chip. He described the chip as representing a new technology that puts the company miles ahead of the competition. He also explained that if their rivals got hold of the chip, the company would be sunk.\n2. Motive: George's motive for stealing the chip could be financial gain. If he stole the chip and sold it to the company's rivals, he could potentially make a lot of money. Additionally, if the company's competitors were aware of the technology, they might be willing to offer George a high-paying job or other incentives.\n3. Opportunity: George had the opportunity to steal the chip. As the office manager, he had access to the safe where the chip was stored. He also had the opportunity to tamper with the security system, which would have disabled the surveillance cameras and allowed him\nExonerating evidence for George Wilson: \n\n1. No mean: George Wilson has no history of theft or violence. He is a hardworking and dedicated employee who has been with the company for many years. He has no reason to steal the chip or harm the company.\n2. No motive: George Wilson has no financial problems or personal issues that would motivate him to steal the chip. He is not in debt and has a stable family life. He has no reason to jeopardize his job and reputation for personal gain.\n3. No opportunity: George Wilson was with his assistant, Donna Blake, when the safe was opened and the chip was stolen. He did not have the opportunity to commit the crime himself. Additionally, the safe was found blown open, suggesting a professional job, which contradicts the idea that George Wilson, a regular office manager, would have the skills or resources to pull off such a heist.\n\nIncriminating evidence for Jeffery Sharp: \n\n1. Mean: Jeffery Sharp had a motive to steal the chip because he was about to go on a two-week vacation and needed money. He had been working overtime lately and was stressed about finishing his tasks before leaving.\n2. Motive: Jeffery had the motive to steal the chip because he needed money for his vacation and was stressed about completing his tasks before leaving.\n3. Opportunity: Jeffery had the opportunity to steal the chip because he had access to the office and the safe, and he was the one in charge of the computer system. He could have tampered with the security system to gain unauthorized access to the office and safe without being detected.\n\nBased on the evidence, Jeffery Sharp is the most likely suspect for the theft of the computer chip.\nExonerating evidence for Jeffery Sharp: \n\n1. Jeffery Sharp had no opportunity to steal the chip because he was working on the computer system during the time of the robbery.\n2. Jeffery Sharp had no motive to steal the chip because he was leaving the company for a two-week vacation and had no reason to jeopardize his job.\n3. There is no evidence of Jeffery Sharp's mean-spirited behavior or animosity towards the company, George Wilson, or any other employee.\n\nIncriminating evidence for Pete Thompson: \n\n1. Mean: Pete Thompson had the opportunity to steal the chip during the three hours he spent cleaning up the office after the party. As the janitor, he would have had access to the entire building, including the office where the safe was located.\n2. Motive: Pete Thompson's motive for stealing the chip could be financial gain. He may have planned to sell the chip to a competing company or use it to start his own business, potentially making a lot of money in the process.\n3. Opportunity: Pete Thompson's job as a janitor would have given him the opportunity to access the office after the party when everyone else had left. He could have used this time to break into the safe and steal the chip without being noticed.\n\nIn conclusion, there is incriminating evidence against Pete Thompson for the theft of the computer chip. He had the means (access to the office\nExonerating evidence for Pete Thompson: \n\n1. No mean: Pete Thompson has no history of theft or violence. He has been working as a janitor at the company for several years and has always been polite and helpful to the employees.\n2. No motive: Pete Thompson has no financial motive to steal the computer chip. He has a steady job as a janitor, and there is no evidence to suggest that he is in financial trouble or needs money to support a luxurious lifestyle.\n3. No opportunity: The timeline of events does not align with Pete Thompson's actions. He entered the office at 1:00 a.m. to clean up after the party and left at 4:00 a.m. for his next shift at another location, which ended at 5:30 a.m. There is not enough time for him to break into the safe, steal the computer chip, and leave the scene\n\nWho is the culprit?", ['Donna Blake', 'George Wilson', 'Jeffery Sharp', 'Pete Thompson'])

No mean: Mary Thornton is a dedicated cheerleader and a responsible student. She has no history of theft or vandalism, and she seems to genuinely care about the school and its achievements.\n2. No motive: Mary has no apparent reason to steal the second base. She was helping to clean the display case and seemed to be genuinely concerned about its appearance. She had no financial or personal gain from taking the base, and she had no history of conflicts with the baseball team or its members.\n3. No opportunity: Mary was present during the cleaning of the display case and had access to the keys. However, she was with other students during the entire process, and there were no moments when she was alone with the display case. Additionally, she returned the keys to the principal after she finished cleaning the case, which indicates that she had no opportunity to take the base after the cleaning was completed\n\nIncriminating evidence for Randy Newsom: \n\n1. Mean: Randy Newsom had a reputation for being a bit of a troublemaker, but he was also well-liked and respected by his teammates. He had a competitive spirit and was known to push the boundaries, but he generally stayed within the rules.\n2. Motive: Randy was upset that the baseball team's success had been overshadowed by the Derek Jeter visit and the focus on the second base. He may have felt that the team's accomplishments were being diminished and wanted to regain the spotlight.\n3. Opportunity: As the captain of the team, Randy had access to the keys for the display case and was responsible for cleaning it with Shorty Gilstrap. He had the opportunity to take the second base during the cleaning process and replace it with a fake.\nExonerating evidence for Randy Newsom: \n\n1. Randy Newsom was not at the school when the theft occurred. He was picking up his date for the banquet.\n2. Randy Newsom had no motive to steal the second base, as he was proud of the team's accomplishments and had been supportive throughout the season.\n3. Randy Newsom did not have the opportunity to steal the second base, as he was with other people while cleaning the display case, and he returned the keys to Coach Morgan afterward.\n\nIncriminating evidence for Shorty Gilstrap: \n\n1. Mean: Shorty Gilstrap had a reputation for being a prankster, always looking for a laugh. He was known for pulling harmless pranks on his teammates, but sometimes his jokes went too far.\n2. Motive: Shorty was upset that the team's success was overshadowed by the Derek Jeter magic. He felt that the team's hard work was being ignored, and he wanted to prove that they didn't need Jeter's help to succeed.\n3. Opportunity: Shorty had access to the display case when he was helping Randy clean it. He had a chance to take the second base when no one was looking, and he had the knowledge to replace the trophies in a way that would make it look like they were never moved.\nExonerating evidence for Shorty Gilstrap: \n\n1. No mean: Shorty Gilstrap is a well-liked member of the baseball team, and he has no history of theft or other malicious behavior.\n2. No motive: There is no clear reason for Shorty to steal the second base, as he has no apparent financial need or desire for personal gain.\n3. No opportunity: Shorty was with Randy Newsom when they cleaned the display case, and both boys were supervised by Mary Thornton. Additionally, Shorty had to leave to help set up tables, which would not have given him enough time to steal the base and leave the scene undetected.\n\nWho is the culprit?", ['Coach Joe Morgan', 'Mary Thornton', 'Randy Newsom', 'Shorty Gilstrap'])

The motive for Matthew hiding in the closet is to play a game with his brother Andy and their father. The opportunity for Matthew to hide in the closet arises because the closet door is open, providing a perfect hiding spot. The mean, or evidence, for the hall closet is the fact that Matthew is found inside, playing a game of hide-and-seek with his brother. This location is crucial to the story because it provides the resolution to the search for Matthew and showcases the bond between the two brothers and their father.\nExonerating evidence for The hall closet: \n\nFive -year- old Andy, (5 1/2, as he would tell you), came to his father early one evening and said, “Matthew is hiding.

The family had been notified of her heart attack just after dinner, and they spent the rest of the evening at the hospital. Amanda was grateful they all had the opportunity to say goodbye to her before she slipped into quiet sleep. They arrived home late. “No wonder the boys look fatigued”, she thought. “It’s been a trying time for us all.” Amanda looked affectionately at her four boys as they hurriedly ate breakfast.

He is currently getting poor grades, which could be a motive for him to skip class.\n2. Motive: Kyle may have felt overwhelmed by his academic struggles and decided to take a break from school, possibly hoping to avoid the stress of attending class and facing his poor performance.\n3. Opportunity: As the youngest sibling, Kyle may have felt overshadowed by his older brothers' successes. This could have given him the opportunity to seek attention in a different way, such as skipping class and creating a situation where his family and the school would focus on him. Additionally, since the school is close to their home, Kyle may have had the opportunity to sneak back home without being noticed.\nExonerating evidence for Kyle: \n\n1. No mean: Kyle is described as a well-behaved child who doesn't cause trouble and has a healthy desire to get along with his teachers and the vice principal.\n2. No motive: Kyle is not a troublemaker, so he has no reason to skip class or get into trouble.\n3. No opportunity: Kyle lives close to the school, and he walks there with his brothers every day. It would be easy for his mother to notice if he didn't go to school. Additionally, the school is well-patrolled by crossing guards and a police squad car, making it difficult for Kyle to skip class without being noticed.\n\nWho is the culprit?", ['Caleb', 'Conner', 'Jordan', 'Kyle'])
