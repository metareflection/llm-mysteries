The culprit is Kyle.
The culprit is Kyle. He said he left the classroom at 5:00 to refill the Bunsen burners in the chemistry lab. The chemistry lab is located on the other side of the gymnasium. The gymnasium is on the other side of the school from Mr. Womback’s classroom. It would have taken Kyle at least 5 minutes to walk to the gym, another 5 minutes to refill the Bunsen burners, and another 5 minutes to walk back to the biology classroom. That means that Kyle could not have left the classroom until at least 5:15. But he said he left at 5:00. So he lied. And if he lied about that, then he probably lied about locking the doors. Which means that he was the one who let the frogs out.
The suspects are Kyle Kravetsky,Marnie Pepper,Matilda Robbens,Sergio Ramos

I am the culprit.
I found the phone in the sink. I had forgotten to put it back in my pocket when I finished drying off.
If I had not been so busy changing my shirt and putting on a new one, I would have remembered to put my phone back in my pocket.
The kids had been giggling because they knew I had forgotten my phone and were going to blackmail me.
This was my yearly trip to the Baltimore aquarium with my nieces and nephews.
I had been calmly sleeping during the dolphin show when I suddenly found myself totally soaked in cold salt water.
I called my sister Tracy asking her what time we needed to be home for dinner.
As I finished shopping, I called my sister Tracy asking her what time we needed to be home for dinner. Fortunately, dinner was not going to be for several hours, so there was still time to sneak in a quick trip for ice cream with the kids.
I slipped my phone back into my shirt pocked and headed to the nearest rest room to try and dry off.
I grabbed my wet shirt and put it in the bag the T-shirt came in and headed to the door to meet Collin and Rory.
I put on my new T-shirt, I let out a little “YeeHaa”, letting the world know how good a clean dry shirt felt. I grabbed my wet shirt and put it in the bag the T-shirt came in and headed to the door to meet Collin and Rory.

None of the kids’ Mom’s knew that each year after hitting the aquarium, I always took the kids out for their first ice cream cone of the year. It was an Uncle Buck tradition. The moms loved that I took them to the aquarium, while they prepared for the annual family BBQ.

The answer is: Burt.
Burt had been telling the story about the Bigfoot monster, and it would've been hard for anyone else to sneak into the woods and set up the monster. It was hidden behind a rock, and the tape recorder was only turned on after the five of us were already asleep. And if Burt had been telling the story, he'd probably already known where the monster was hidden.

There was a time when the only people who could be considered as being in the “middle class” were those who had to work for a living. These people were not wealthy enough to be considered “rich,” but they weren’t poor either. They worked hard for a living and made enough money to live a comfortable lifestyle.
Today, the term “middle class” is used to describe a wide range of people. In fact, it’s often used to describe people who are not even in the middle class.

## 5minutemystery-the-april-fool


Answer:

The answer is Philadelphia, PA.

The first step is to determine the direction that the train is traveling. To do this, look at the numbers for each city. All of the cities are in the northeast, so the train is traveling northeast.

Next, we need to figure out how long it takes the train to travel 94 miles. This is done by dividing the distance (94 miles) by the speed (30 miles per hour). The answer is 3 hours and 12 minutes.

Since the train arrives at 10:00 am, it must have left at 6:48 am.

We know that the train is traveling northeast, so the only city that could be reached in 3 hours and 12 minutes is Philadelphia.

The clues are as follows:

1. The skunks are in a crate. The crate is the same color as the Philadelphia Eagles.
2. The statue is of Rocky Balboa, a fictional character from the movie Rocky, which takes place in Philadelphia.
3. The biking trail is the Schuylkill River Trail, which is located in Philadelphia.
4. The clock on the crate is set to 6:48, which is the time that the train left New York City.

Comment: I'm not sure about the clock clue. Doesn't the clock show the time when the train arrived at the destination?

Comment: The clock is on the crate. The crate is in the front of the boxcar, so the clock is facing the front.

Comment: Oh, I see. I thought the crate is in the back of the boxcar.

Comment: The crate is in the front of the boxcar. The skunks are in the crate. The clock is on the crate. The clock is facing the front of the boxcar.
The suspects are Boston, MA,Philadelphia, PA,Pittsburgh, PA,Raleigh, NC,Washington, DC

Uncle Robert continued, “Well, the waiter was very helpful. He told me that the Italian chef was very popular. He was flirting with the female customers seated nearest to the serving area as he sprinkled fresh basil across a row of lasagna’s all lined up in blue dishes, capped at the end by one in a red dish.” “Wow, that sounds like a very good dish!” Peter said. “It does, but I didn’t order it. I decided to go with the French onion soup. After all, the waiter had told me that it had been popular at lunch, and the chef was making another session for the evening customers. I hoped that this would be the clue I needed to identify the spy’s contact.” “Did you get the microchip?” Jane asked. “Yes, I did,” Uncle Robert replied. “The waiter brought me a bowl of soup and a red plate. I lifted the plate and there, underneath, was the microchip! I pocketed the microchip and ordered a coffee, hoping to delay my departure from the restaurant. But, as I sipped the coffee, I began to wonder whether I had made the right choice. After all, I had no real proof that the French chef was the spy’s contact. I decided to test my theory. I called the waiter over and asked him to send each of the chefs out, one by one, so that I could thank them for their wonderful cooking. He agreed, and the first chef to step out was the Italian chef. He was still flirting with the women at the table nearest to the serving area. I decided to ask him a question. I said: ‘I’m very sorry, but I have forgotten your name. Would you be so kind as to tell me what it is?’ He smiled and said: ‘My name is Gianni Girodano.’” “Wow, that’s a great name!” Peter said. “It is, Peter, and I thanked him for his cooking and asked him to return to the kitchen. The next chef to step out was the Japanese chef. He was juggling ingredients like they were going out of style. I stopped him and said: ‘Excuse me, I’ve forgotten your name. Would you please tell me what it is?’ He stopped and said: ‘My name is Atsushi Nishi.’ I thanked him for his cooking and asked him to return to the kitchen.” “Wow, that’s a great name too!” Peter said. “It is, Peter, and I thanked him for his cooking and asked him to return to the kitchen. The next chef to step out was the Scottish chef. He was preparing the traditional haggis and trimmings. I stopped him and said: ‘Excuse me, I’ve forgotten your name. Would you please tell me what it is?’ He stopped and said: ‘My name is Jack McDonald.’ I thanked him for his cooking and asked him to return to the kitchen. The final chef to step out was the French chef. He was preparing the French onion soup. I stopped him and said: ‘Excuse me, I’ve forgotten your name. Would you please tell me what it is?’ He stopped and said: ‘My name is Jean-Pierre Dubois.’ I thanked him for his cooking and asked him to return to the kitchen. I decided that I had enough information, so I paid my bill and left the restaurant. Back at the station, I was able to prove that the French chef was the contact because he was the only chef who had to prepare another session for the evening customers. And this matched the clue I had found in the spy’s wallet. I was able to arrest the chef, and he is now behind bars.” “Wow, that was a great story, Uncle Robert!” Peter said. “Yes, it was,” Jane agreed. “Thank you, Uncle Robert. That was a great story. I’m going to sleep now. Goodnight, Uncle Robert.” “Goodnight, children,” Uncle Robert said. “Sweet dreams.”
This is a very interesting story. I like it.

Would you please tell me what it is?’ He stopped and said: ‘My name is Jean-Pierre Dubois.’ I thanked him for his cooking and asked him to return to the kitchen. I decided that I had enough information, so I paid my bill and left the restaurant. Back at the station, I was able to prove that the French chef was the contact because he was the only chef who had to prepare another session for the evening customers. And this matched the clue I had found in the spy’s wallet. I was able to arrest the chef, and he is now behind bars.” “Wow, that was a great story, Uncle Robert!” Peter said. “Yes, it was,” Jane agreed. “Thank you, Uncle Robert. That was a great story. I’m going to sleep now. Goodnight, Uncle Robert.” “Goodnight, children,” Uncle Robert said. “Sweet dreams.”\nThis is a very interesting story. I like it.\nSo as explained, the culprit is', ['Atsushi Nishi', 'Gianni Girodano', 'Jack McDonald', 'Jean-Pierre Dubois'])
The culprit is Jean-Pierre Dubois.

In fact, it is Gianni Girodano.

The culprit is Rufus.
The culprit is Rufus. The fake pearls were left behind in the cabinet. They were made of glass, so they would show up on the x-ray scans. Rufus ate Tom's meatloaf and the pearls were made of glass. Glass is made from sand and sand is made of silicon dioxide. Silicon dioxide is a chemical that is also found in dog food. When Rufus ate the meatloaf, he was able to digest the pearls and leave them in his potty breaks. That's why the x-ray scans were normal. The only other clue was that Tom found the string in the cash-box. He had to have put it there since he was the only one who had access to the box. He used the string to wrap the money so that Christopher would think he had used the string that was already in the box.
The suspects are Christopher,Earl,Robert,Tom

Since the tape was missing at 6:45 am, it had to have been taken between 12:43 am and 6:45 am. Since Tom was the only person in the building from midnight to 6:45 am, he must have taken the tape. Since Tom said he did not take the tape, he must be lying. If he is lying, then he must have had a reason to lie. The only reason he would have to lie is if he knew who took the tape.

The culprit is Danny. The clues are: 1) Tom has kitchen duty. 2) Danny took some campers on a 20-mile hike the previous day. 3) Cindy had cramps in her calves. 4) Allie is not back yet. Danny, who was the only one not at the scene of the prank, was the only one who could have rigged the buckets. He was also the only one who could have known about Cindy’s cramps. It was the cramps that caused her to get up and go to the bathroom at 3:00 a.m. The culprit was Danny. He was the only one who knew about the cramps. He used the cramps to his advantage. He knew that Cindy would be the one who would go to the bathroom at 3:00 a.m. and that Diane would have to escort her. He also knew that Diane would be the first one to leave the cabin in the morning. The 20-mile hike was just a red herring.
A man was found dead in his study. He was slumped over his desk and a gun was in his hand. There was a cassette recorder on his desk.

The police accuse the man’s wife. The tape was made while the man and his wife were in the room. The wife shot her husband and then made it look like a suicide. She had the tape recorder in her hand when she shot him. After the shot was fired, she rewound the tape to the beginning and set it on the desk.

Here is a mystery story. Your role is to find who is the culprit. “Here she goes, boys!” Tom Carlson called, turning on the hose and letting the water loose. He triumphantly swept the hose back and forth, spraying water onto the plastic liner of the hockey rink he’d built in his own backyard with the help of his son, Tom Junior. The rink was 1/4 scale of an NHL rink, complete with wooden boards, Plexiglass partitions, floodlights and even an electronic scoreboard mounted at one end. It had taken the two Toms all summer and fall to build, and now, with temperatures plummeting, it was finally ready to be put into operation. “Just think,” Tom Sr. said, throwing an arm around his son’s shoulders, as he guided the hose with the other, “you’ll be able to practice and play all winter long, right here in your own backyard. Just like Wayne Gretzky when he was your age!” “Super, Dad!” Tom Jr., known as TJ, enthused. The spunky eleven year-old was an even bigger hockey aficionado than his father, following the local AHL team, the Manitoba Moose, with true fan fervor. “Yep, you are one lucky pucky,” Mikey Chanowski marveled. “My dad won’t even let me play badminton in our backyard.” Mikey was one of TJ’s friends, over to watch the big hose down. “Well, you can come over and play with TJ anytime you want,” Tom said, “between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.” “How long before the ice freezes properly and we can start skating on it, Mr. Carlson?” Shea Callaghan, another of TJ’s friends asked. “Well, it’s supposed to go down to minus twenty tonight – warm for this time of year in Winnipeg, but still cold enough – so it should be frozen solid by morning for sure.” “Awesome!” Shea yelped. “What’s the time now, Mr. Carlson? My parents can’t afford a backyard hockey rink, but they’re taking me to the game tonight. Maybe the Moose will finally break out of their losing streak.” Tom flipped his wrist and glanced at his watch, accidentally giving Mikey an ice-water face-wash in the process. “Whoops! Sorry, Mikey. Uh, it’s almost six-thirty, Shea.” “Gotta go,” the skinny youngster in the Winnipeg Jets jersey said. “See you around, TJ.” “Yeah,” Mikey said, “I guess I better get going, too.” He sneezed, wiping his nose on the same Boston Bruins’ parka sleeve he’d just dried his face on. “Meet you back here to walk to school in the morning, like usual?” TJ asked. Mikey lived just down the street, Shea a couple of blocks over. “You can check out the rink with the ice all in.” “Sure.” The ear muffed redhead let loose another sneeze. “Later, gator!” Father and son stood watch, as the streaming, steaming water flooded the rink, slowly crystallizing their dreams of backyard shinny. “So, you two hosers are actually going ahead with it, eh?” Tom and TJ glanced at their next-door-neighbor, Joe Tucker, who’d wandered into their yard uninvited. Joe ‘Blow’ (as Tom called the whining windbag) had groused his concerns many a time previous about the prospective noise level from having a bunch of kids playing hockey so close to his property and about the possibility of frozen pucks flying into his yard and maybe through his windows. He sniffed at the swirling water, nose held high. “Yup, we’re almost ready to face-off for the first time,” TJ bragged, beaming up at his dad. “Humph!” Joe harrumphed. “Just keep the noise and the pucks down, is all I ask. Or I’m calling the cops.” He turned to leave, and slipped on a puddle of ice, landing on his amply padded rear end with a thump. “Ooohhh!” he moaned, as TJ rushed over to help him back to his feet. Tom kept right on watering the rink. “That’s just great for my aching back,” Joe groaned, “I already can hardly lift a thing at work!” “That reminds me, Dad,” TJ said, “I better go sand Mrs. Lacombe’s steps before she goes out to get the paper in the morning. It’s pretty icy around here.” “Merci, TJ!” Hortence Lacombe called from over the neighboring fence on the other side, where she’d been watching the proceedings. “You’re such a good boy to remember an old lady. You’re going to grow up to be another Maurice ‘Rocket’ Richard with your new hockey rink, no?” Rocket Richard was Hortence’s favorite hockey player – her father had taken her to see the hall-of-famer play at the old Montreal Forum when she was just a child, many, many years ago. “More like Alexandre Bolduc,” TJ replied, naming his favorite player on the current Moose roster. * TJ was up at the crack of dawn the following morning, anxious to see the new ice on the new rink. He listened to the sportscast on the radio as he threw on his clothes, cheering when he heard that his beloved Moose had finally broken out of their slump with a late goal in overtime. Then he pulled on his boots and parka and raced out into the backyard. His father was standing by the hockey rink, his shoulders slumped. “Someone vandalized our new rink last night,” the man groaned. “Poured salt all over the ice – ruined it!” TJ stared at the cratered and pockmarked ice surface, where the salt had melted through it, at the empty twenty-five pound bag of road salt that had blown into a corner of the messed-up rink. The salt was a commonplace brand that people all over Manitoba used on their driveways and walkways and steps in the wintertime to melt ice and improve traction. “Telephone, TJ!” his mom called from the backdoor. It was Mikey Chanowski’s mother, informing TJ that Mikey wouldn’t be stopping by his house to walk with him to school, since he was sick in bed with the flu. “That’s tough,” TJ responded. “Yes, it is,” Mikey’s mother agreed. “He was sneezing and coughing so badly when he got back from your house last night, I had to put him straight to bed.” No sooner had TJ hung up, than the phone rang again. This time it was Shea, asking when he could come over to play hockey. “Cool your jets, Golden Jet,” TJ replied dejectedly. “Someone ruined the ice.” He sighed. “How was the Moose game, anyway?” “Ruined the ice!” Shea shrieked over the phone. “Ah, man, that reeks! The Moose game wasn’t bad – same old, same old, ya know.” TJ hung up for a second time. Then he wandered back out into the backyard to stare at the scarred and pitted ice surface with his father again. “If it’s any consolation, Dad,” he said, “I know who did this.” Tom glanced down at his son, surprised. “You do? Who?” Who ruined the ice?

The reason is that she has a bad leg, and she cannot walk easily on the ice.

gen('\nIf you want to check your answer, please click here.\nHere is a mystery story. Your role is to find who is the culprit. “Here she goes, boys!” Tom Carlson called, turning on the hose and letting the water loose. He triumphantly swept the hose back and forth, spraying water onto the plastic liner of the hockey rink he’d built in his own backyard with the help of his son, Tom Junior. The rink was 1/4 scale of an NHL rink, complete with wooden boards, Plexiglass partitions, floodlights and even an electronic scoreboard mounted at one end. It had taken the two Toms all summer and fall to build, and now, with temperatures plummeting, it was finally ready to be put into operation. “Just think,” Tom Sr. said, throwing an arm around his son’s shoulders, as he guided the hose with the other, “you’ll be able to practice and play all winter long, right here in your own backyard. Just like Wayne Gretzky when he was your age!” “Super, Dad!” Tom Jr., known as TJ, enthused. The spunky eleven year-old was an even bigger hockey aficionado than his father, following the local AHL team, the Manitoba Moose, with true fan fervor. “Yep, you are one lucky pucky,” Mikey Chanowski marveled. “My dad won’t even let me play badminton in our backyard.” Mikey was one of TJ’s friends, over to watch the big hose down. “Well, you can come over and play with TJ anytime you want,” Tom said, “between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.” “How long before the ice freezes properly and we can start skating on it, Mr. Carlson?” Shea Callaghan, another of TJ’s friends asked. “Well, it’s supposed to go down to minus twenty tonight – warm for this time of year in Winnipeg, but still cold enough – so it should be frozen solid by morning for sure.” “Awesome!” Shea yelped. “What’s the time now, Mr. Carlson?

Johnny’s flute was in the case of the French horn.
The culprit is Lyle.
Lyle Esposito was next on board, carrying his French horn. He said hello to Ed, then stumbled on a step and sprawled headlong in front of the man. His French horn case broke open to reveal the large golden instrument inside. It was packed tight into the case’s molded, red velvet lining, so it wouldn’t rattle around and get damaged when carried. As a result, it stayed stuck in the form fitting lining now, preventing it from flying out and hitting the aisle or Ed. “Careful with that, son,” Ed said. “Clasp it back together and then stow it under your seat.” Lyle nodded, red-faced. He secured the heavy case and hefted it down the aisle to where Marty was sitting and laughing.
The culprit is Marty.
Marty Nolan was next to board the bus. He was carrying a hockey bag which was tightly packed.
“Morning, Mr. Tuttle,” Marty Nolan said politely, the first of the five to board the bus. The stocky thirteen year-old had his hockey bag looped over his shoulder. The large bag bulged tight with equipment, wedging against the handrails in the stairwell of the bus. “Game tonight?” Ed asked. “You bet, Mr. Tuttle,” Marty responded enthusiastically. “We’re whipping Glenford tonight.” Ed smiled. He admired the kid’s spirit, if not his playing ability, which consisted mainly of elbows and stick work. “Put the bag under your seat, okay?” Marty nodded and crab-walked down the aisle of the bus.
The culprit is Susan.
Susan is the only one who can see Johnny from behind.
Susan is the only one who can see Johnny from behind. She can also see the flute case.
The culprit is Chloe.
Chloe was carrying a backpack.
Chloe Streamer trudged up the steps next, a large backpack strapped to her back. She turned to snip at Johnny Nolan behind her. “I still say Mrs. Murphy only picked you for first flute because she wanted a token boy in the front row.” The girl sniffed and turned back around, smiling sweetly at Ed.
The culprit is Johnny.
Johnny was sitting on the right-hand side of the bus, near the back, his lunchbox clasped next to him on the seat, flute case between his feet on the floor.

Ruth Majick is the culprit.
It is obvious that she is the one.
The fact that she was limping along the corridor, a crutch clutched under her right arm.
It was a snowy weather, and she was walking with a crutch.
It is impossible to walk in the snow with a crutch.
The murderer had wanted to catch Tembeck by surprise by quietly snowshoeing onto the man’s acreage rather than roaring in on a snowmobile.
So, it is impossible to walk in the snow with a crutch.

It’s Dan. He’s the only one who was carrying a pencil that broke. He couldn’t fix it, so he took Tro’s.
Haha! I guessed it.
I’ve got to go to the bathroom.
He ran back to the audit room, closing the door behind him so that the client staff didn’t hear any more.
“You sure?” he asked Tro.
“Yes! It was lying right on my desk at the front when we left. You saw it. Now it’s gone!”
“Someone must’ve swiped it while we were out to lunch,” Shel said.
“You sure you have the only key to this room, Steve?”
Steve ruefully rubbed his chin. “I said I had a key. Not the only one. Benjamin has another.”
Tro’s eyebrows shot up. “You think-”
“Yes, I think I know exactly who took your mechanical pencil,” Steve responded.
Who stole the pencil?
Think step-by-step.
Can you tell me who is the culprit?

Can you tell me who is the culprit?
You’re right, but why?
It’s not a mystery story. It’s a simple story.
The culprit is the one who said “You gotta relax your attitude about that bike, dude,” String commented. “It’s not made of glass, you know.”
Because the culprit was the only one who knew that Matthew’s bike was not made of glass.
“I got a flat,” the freckle-faced redhead replied, pointing at the bald back tire of his beat-up bicycle.
“I used some tools in your garage, Matthew, if that’s alright?” David plopped down into a chair.
“No problemo,” the curly haired boy responded, banging String’s flaming wreck right off the track.
“The punk’s crafty,” Matthew scowled, stroking the dust off his bike with a Kleenex.
“I got a real rough track picked out for you squirts today,” he said. The square-built blonde was half-a-year older than the rest of the boys and leader of the pack, as a result. “Think you and your precious new tricycle can handle it, Matthew?”
“This baby can handle anything,” Matthew sneered back, patting his chrome handlebars.
“My front wheel came off!” Matthew wailed. He let David help him to his feet, nothing injured except his brand-new bike and his pride.
Cory squatted down beside the busted bicycle and picked up two shiny metal nuts. They were the axle nuts that secured the front wheel to the front forks of the bike, and when they’d come off, the wheel had come free, pitching Matthew right over the handlebars and onto the trail.
“These babies must’ve been deliberately loosened, to fly off a new bike like that,” Cory said. “Lucky you weren’t riding down a hill or something – you could’ve really been hurt.”
“Sabotage!” Matthew cried. “This wasn’t one of your stupid practical jokes, was it?” David asked String.
String scratched his bony skull. “What, and miss it? What’s the point of a practical joke if you don’t see it happen?”
“Was anyone fooling around with your bike before you came here, Matthew?” Cory asked.
Matthew sniffled, brushing off his jeans and t-shirt. “No, I don’t think …” An angry gleam suddenly shone in his watery brown eyes. “Yeah, wait a minute-”
“Wait a minute, indeed,” String interrupted. He walked over to Cory and popped the axle nuts out of the boy’s hand and deftly caught them in his own hand. “I know who loosened these,” he said. “And we all know why.”
Who sabotaged the bike?
1. Who is the culprit?
2. Why is he the culprit?
3. What is the evidence?
1. String.
2. Because he is the only one who knew that Matthew’s bike was not made of glass.
3. The axle nuts.
2. Because he is the only one who knew that Matthew’s bike was not made of glass. He said “You gotta relax your attitude about that bike, dude,” String commented. “It’s not made of glass, you know.”
This is a mystery story.
The story is about a boy who got his bike sabotaged.
Who sabotaged his bike?
Why is he the culprit?
The culprit is the one who said “You gotta relax your attitude about that bike, dude,” String commented. “It’s not made of glass, you know.” Because he is the only one who knew that Matthew’s bike was not made of glass.

"I'm not a leprechaun!" Randy said angrily. "I'm not even Irish!"
"Don't embarrass me," Casey teased.
"Maybe I should hand out boxes of Lucky Charms," Randy joked.
"We both need the cash," he reminded Randy, lifting him onto his shoulder. "So wave to the nice crowd."
"Can we go home now?" Randy whined.
"We can't," Casey said, lifting him down to the floor. "I promised the teachers that we'd visit their party in the teacher's lounge."
"Sorry the children grabbed you," Mr. Carswell said sincerely to Randy.
"Did you see the trophy from that 1983 game? It's at the top of our display case in the lobby. It's over two feet tall, and it's actually worth a lot of money."
"Unfortunately, it's gone!" shouted Mrs. Huntington.
"I bet I know the little devil who's behind this," Mr. Carswell said.
"Not you," said Mr. Carswell. "I meant a student named Barry. He's a second-grader and the star football player on the team these days. But everyone tells him he's not as good as the 1983 quarterback, and I think he resents it. Barry's always getting into trouble."
"I was," admitted Mr. Carswell. "All the children were already in the auditorium to see 'The Mighty Casey'. I saw the trophy in its case as I closed the auditorium's doors, just as you two came onto the stage."
"I was on duty in the auditorium just now, during the party. We teachers watch our students carefully, but an event like this it’s easy to be overwhelmed,” Mrs. Huntington said. "It's possible that Barry slipped away. But I know I saw him in the auditorium at some point this morning."
"You can stop searching," Randy announced. "Because I know where the trophy is."

Your Role Is To Find Who Is The Culprit. Jack Snyder Had Two Great Loves In His Life: 1) Old Fashioned Horror Films (Which By Today’s Standards Are Not Horror Films At All) And 2) His Family. His Priorities Were Not Necessarily In This Order. One Of The Great Joys Of Jack’s Life Was To Invite One Or More Of His Grandsons To Spend Friday Or Saturday Night At His Home. “Granddad Jack” And His Grandsons Would Select A Vhs Tape Or Dvd From His Extensive Library And Watch It In The Family Room After His Wife, Candace, Went To Bed. The Boys Loved Doing This. They Felt Like Adults Staying Up Later Than Their Grandma. Also, Jack Always Made Sure There Was Popcorn Available. Turning Off The Family Room Lights And Viewing An Old Black And White Film On The Big Screen Television Added To The Atmosphere. Andy, Matt And David Genuinely Enjoyed Their Granddad’s Old Films. Dennis, At Age Seven, The Youngest Of The Boys, Did Not Enjoy The Horror Films As Much As The Others, But Did Like To Stay Up Late And Eat Popcorn. One Friday Evening Just After School Was Out For The Summer, Candace And Jack Agreed To Keep All Four Boys For The Weekend So Their Parents Could Take A Three-Day Mini Vacation – Alone. The Boys Ranged In Age From 13-Year-Old Andy To 7-Year-Old Dennis. 11-Year-Old Matthew Was Especially Excited As It Was His Turn To Pick Out What They Would View On This Early June Friday Night. After Dinner, Jack And The Boys Went Upstairs To His Office Library, A Converted Bedroom Where He Kept His Collection In What Used To Be The Bedroom Closet. The Closet Doors Had Been Removed For Ease Of Access And The Boys Never Tired Of Looking At It. Jack Placed Great Emphasis On Keeping The Tapes And Dvds Chronicled And Placed In Alphabetical Order. Tonight, As Always, Every Film In His Library Was Accounted For And In Its Proper Place. After Much Deliberation, Matthew Selected Fall Of The House Of Usher, A 1960 Film Starring The Great Vincent Price As The Tormented Roderick Usher. This Was One Of Jack’s Favorites. He Was Delighted That It Was One Of Matthew’s As Well -- He Had Selected This Film Several Times When It Was His Turn To Choose. They Took The Dvd Downstairs And Placed It By The Television In The Family Room. Jack And The Boys Were All Set For What They Referred To As Their “Late Night Horror Show.” But, Before Grandma’s Bedtime The Evening Lay Before Them. The Snyder’s Backyard Was Huge And Was The Place Of Many Family Gatherings. Jack Played With The Boys Outside On The Swing Set And Also Engaged The Boys In Pitch And Catch. Candace Sat In The Sandbox With Dennis, Who Would Shortly Be Too Old To Enjoy This Any Longer. Candace Lamented That David Had Tired Of It At About The Same Age Dennis Is Now. The Six Of Them Stayed Outside Until Dark, A Little Over Two Hours. David Went Inside Once To Get Soft Drinks For Everyone. At 9:00 P.M., The Family Came Inside To Clean Up And Watch Television Until Grandma’s Bedtime. The Boys Took Turns Showering And Changing Clothes In The Downstairs Bathroom. Jack Dozed Off In His Chair As They Prepared For The Night. Candace Was Busy Getting The Boys Clean Clothes And Watching Bits Of The News. After Showering, Andy Hobbled Painfully To The Kitchen For An Apple. Candace Gave Him Permission To Sleep Downstairs Because He Had Twisted His Ankle Playing Outside, And It Was Painful For Him To Climb The Stairs. Matthew Went Upstairs To Find His Toothbrush But Quickly Yelled For Candace To Come Upstairs And Help Him Find It. Matthew’s Overnight Bag Was In The Guest Bedroom Opposite The Top Of The Stairs, And She Observed Him Searching In Vain For The Toothbrush. As Candace’s Bedtime Approached, Jack Went Upstairs To Turn Off His Computer, When He Noticed His Vhs Copy Of Attack Of The 50 Foot Woman Was Missing From Its Place On The First Row Shelf.

Answer: The culprit is Niles Anderson, the company accountant.
Niles had the opportunity to kill Trevor Jones because he was the only one who didn’t go to lunch with the others. He was sick from eating bad fish, so he went back to his room. He could have easily slipped into the pool and killed Trevor while he was swimming, then gone back to his room.
Niles had the motive to kill Trevor because he was the one who was most disgruntled with him. Trevor was a drill sergeant type of leader who didn’t compliment or smile at anyone. Niles said he was the one who counted every penny so many times that he might as well have been doing Niles’ job.
Niles also had the means to kill Trevor. Since Niles was an accountant, he had to be good at math. He could have counted the number of laps Trevor was doing, then slipped into the pool and drowned him just before he finished.

## 5minutemystery-who-stole-storimons-wallet

First, I looked at the police officer. He'd been eating a doughnut, so his hands had been covered with chocolate. But when he held out the wallet to Mr. Storimon, his hands were clean. He'd had enough time to wipe off his hands, and to hide the hundred dollar bills in his pockets. But he hadn't been at the bus stop when the wallet was dropped, so he couldn't have known the money was there. Next, I looked at Danny, the skateboarder. He had a cast on his left arm, so he could've pretended to drop his skateboard. He could've reached down to pick it up, and then reached into Mr. Storimon's pocket to steal the wallet. But the skateboard was still standing on the sidewalk when Mr. Storimon discovered that his wallet was missing. Danny couldn't have reached down to pick up the skateboard without the police officer seeing him. Next, I looked at Mick. He was the only person at the bus stop when the wallet was dropped. But he'd been sitting on the bench, and he was wearing thick mittens. He couldn't have reached into Mr. Storimon's pocket to steal the wallet. Then I looked at Mr. Storimon himself. He'd dropped the wallet, so he could've pretended to drop it on purpose. He could've taken the hundred dollar bills out of his wallet, and then pretended he'd dropped the wallet. But the police officer was still eating his doughnut, so he would've seen Mr. Storimon reach into his own pocket to steal the money. That left only one possibility. Mr. Storimon was still shouting at the police officer, who was still eating his doughnut. "You're a thief," Mr. Storimon said. "You're a thief," the police officer said. "You're a thief," Mr. Storimon said. "You're a thief," the police officer said. "Stop it!" I said. "The thief is the cab driver." "What?" said Mr. Storimon. "You're crazy," said the police officer. "I'm not," I said. "The cab driver had a chance to steal the money. He was the only person who could've reached into Mr. Storimon's pocket." "I never even saw the cab driver," Mr. Storimon said. "I didn't see him either," said the police officer. "How can you be sure?" "Because the cab driver gave Mr. Storimon a twenty-dollar bill in change," I said. "He had to know that Mr. Storimon had a hundred dollar bill in his wallet." "But how did you know that?" asked Mr. Storimon. "Because I saw you drop the wallet," I said. "I saw the money in the wallet, and I saw the cab driver pick it up." "You're lying," said the police officer. "You were sleeping." "No, I was awake," I said. "I just didn't say anything, because I didn't want to get in trouble. I was afraid that the cab driver would come back and hurt me. "But the cab driver couldn't have come back," Mr. Storimon said. "He drove away before I even got out of the cab." "That's why I knew it was him," I said. "Because he couldn't come back." "But why didn't you say anything?" asked Mr. Storimon. "Because I was afraid he'd come back and hurt me," I said. "But he didn't come back," Mr. Storimon said. "That's why I knew it was him," I said. "Because he didn't come back."

The Three Weiss Men are all too tall and heavy to have fit into the Santa suit. The plumber boy is diabetic and wouldn’t have been able to taste the candy cane to know it was sweet. That leaves the store owner, Merv Weiss, as the only logical culprit. Merv had a key to the store, and his office was located at the back of the store, close to the loading dock. He could have easily slipped into the Santa suit and stolen his own candy cane, perhaps to keep it as a memento of his store’s holiday tradition.

"The little girl had done a chin-up on the sill, and then climbed inside to see what all those gold pieces were doing on the floor. "Emily, are you telling me the truth," my brother had asked her gently. And Emily nodded her head emphatically up and down -- which is what he'd expect her to do, whether she was telling the truth or not."
The little girl's mother just looked away helplessly."
"I'd seen it there the first time I hunted down Percy, so I began looking around. I found it inside the guest cottage, a pile of smashed pieces from the game computer's circuitry. "And the prime suspect was standing next to it." "Who was it?" "The little girl Percy pushed into the pool."
"But Percy was busy ripping through all the wrapping paper on the presents. But Mrs. Wellington called me over and asked what had happened to the X-Box. With all the gold, it was worth thousands of dollars -- and it was supposed to be on top of the pyramid of presents. But it wasn't. "I'd seen it there the first time I hunted down Percy, so I began looking around. I found it inside the guest cottage, a pile of smashed pieces from the game computer's circuitry. "And the prime suspect was standing next to it." "Who was it?" "The little girl Percy pushed into the pool."
"That's when the robbery occurred. "That was the toughest part of the case," my brother said. "Because when I asked the nannies who hated Percy enough to rob him, they said 'Everybody.'" "All eight of them said it -- at the exact same time." Percy was wired from all the sugar he'd just eaten, and he'd run around continuously for almost half an hour, my brother remembered. Angelita tried to distract him by saying there were still gifts for him at the guest cottage -- and Percy ran back down the path, crazy from the sugar and now frightened someone might steal his presents. But strangely enough, he was half right. All of the presents were there -- except for the most valuable one. "His X-Box had been smashed to bits on the ground. Not just any X-Box, this one was gold-plated." "Oh, come on." "His father had taken it out of its original plastic case, then had a jeweler hand-craft it. It's in the article. I looked down, and read the People magazine article. "Vincent Wellington even commissioned a Greenwich-based artist to create a customized case for young Percy's game console, replacing its ordinary plastic with pure, 14-caret gold." I checked the cover to make sure this was a real copy of People magazine... "We didn't realize it at the time," my brother said, "because Percy was busy ripping through all the wrapping paper on the presents. But Mrs. Wellington called me over and asked what had happened to the X-Box. With all the gold, it was worth thousands of dollars -- and it was supposed to be on top of the pyramid of presents.

"And the prime suspect was standing next to it." "Who was it?" "The little girl Percy pushed into the pool." The cottage had been locked, but there was a window in the back that was left open for ventilation. It was four feet off the ground, but the little girl had done a chin-up on the sill, and then climbed inside to see what all those gold pieces were doing on the floor. "Emily, are you telling me the truth," my brother had asked her gently. And Emily nodded her head emphatically up and down -- which is what he'd expect her to do, whether she was telling the truth or not. "I was terrified of what Percy might do -- an out-of-control boy, wired up on sugar, staring at the pieces of a shiny gold present. Percy's temper was like a ticking time bomb waiting to go off, so I began looking for clues." The window's frame had a bolt so the window couldn't have been opened any higher, and no adult could've crawled inside. There was just one set of footprints leading to the window -- little Emily's -- so my brother ruled out the other children. But three people had keys to the cottage. One was Angelita, the nanny who'd wanted Percy to be disciplined. Had she grabbed the shiniest present and smashed it as a message for his mother? Mrs. Wellington seemed to think so, though she also blamed her husband's secretary, Jessica. "Because Jessica was blonde, and Mrs. Wellington was jealous?" "She probably was. But Percy really hated Jessica and was always playing mean tricks on her. Once, he squirted a bottle of maple syrup into her hair. Jessica was furious -- she screams easily. So she definitely had a motive for revenge." My brother sighed patiently, like he wished some good will could've found the family. "And Percy was a suspect too," he said. "He'd run off to the cottage first, and he could've smashed the X-Box himself -- just to make everyone feel sorry for him. He had his own key, and he was capable of anything. Maybe he was going to blame it on Jessica -- or the little girl." My brother searched frantically for clues, but there weren't any. The cottage was seldom used, so it was still perfectly tidy from the last time it had been cleaned. The doorknob was shiny and spotless, and there was no furniture inside -- just a big empty room with a smashed X-Box on the floor. My brother sighed as he told the story now. "They had all that money, but they were all so crazy." "But at least I figured out who smashed the X-Box." Who destroyed the X-box?

The thief is Zac Coulson.
The thief is Zac Coulson. Eleanor was certain that the thief was Zac because he was the only one who would have been bullied by Marty Clayton.
The thief is Zac Coulson. Eleanor was certain that the thief was Zac because he was the only one who would have been bullied by Marty Clayton. The thief, whoever he was, did not know whom he was dealing with. In her youth, Eleanor had traveled with a depression era gang of bank robbers. Her boyfriend had been killed in a shootout with J. Edgar Hoover’s G-Men and she had served several years in a Federal prison. Eleanor knew no fear and was no stranger to violence, but luckily for this punk who kept robbing her, she was far past her physical prime. As far as she could tell, the robber was one of four boys who lived nearby and whom, she knew, would be familiar with her house and personal habits. As she emptied her coffee cup, the contents of which did not sit well on her diseased stomach, Eleanor pondered the four boys seriously for the first time Todd Summers was the most violent and dangerous of the four. Todd had been in prison for armed robbery and assault. He was out on parole and considered by the local police to be very dangerous, for Todd, as Eleanor in her youth, knew no fear and enjoyed confrontation. Jon Shaw was dangerous only because he was feeble-minded and stupid. Jon looked up to the other tough guys in the neighborhood and had become their lackey. Jon was neither bright nor mean enough to commit serious crime, but he had been in and out of the local jail various times for minor offenses. Eleanor’s friend on the local police force, Sgt. Rick Daniel, often laughed and commented that, “the Shaw kid gets into trouble when he’s with his pals. He’s not smart enough to get into trouble on his own.” Next, Eleanor considered Max Reinke. She frowned as she considered what Max had given up. Max was well over six feet in height, a star basketball player on the local high school team and was headed to the state university on scholarship before he started getting into trouble. The word from her friend Sgt. Daniel was that his problems began when he developed a fondness for alcohol. Last on Eleanor’s suspect list was Zac Coulson. Eleanor knew Zac’s mother and was aware of how broken-hearted she was on her son becoming a thug and overall ne’er-do well. Zac was very rude to all who knew him and a bully to boot. He was always picking on younger, smaller boys and teasing little girls. Eleanor smiled as she remembered the day Marty Clayton caught up with him in her front yard. Marty’s sister had come running home in tears, claiming it was Zac who had tormented her. Marty found him and bloodied his nose. Like most bullies, Zac could not take what he could dish out to persons weaker than himself. He screamed and ran away from Marty before more blows were delivered. The feisty Eleanor had invited Marty in for a cool drink and they had been friends ever since. Eleanor lit a cigarette. It won’t kill me, she thought, stomach cancer is taking care of that. But, after thinking this through, I think I know who my robber is. I’ll be ready for him next time and I’ll know for sure. Grimly, she thought, I have nothing to lose. If he hurts me, I’m not long for this world anyway. I’ve had almost 97 very full years. The strong-willed Eleanor was determined not to die before the thief in the night was dealt with. Eleanor had to wait a couple of weeks, but the thief finally returned, entering as usual through the unlocked front door. Eleanor, whose clock read 2:50 a.m. when he heard the soft sounds of the familiar intruder in the living room, was ready for him. As he stooped to take the now usual $20.00 from the living room coffee table, Eleanor thought bitterly of the tacit arrangement she had made with this two bit amateur hood. She stepped into the room and aimed a pistol into his masked, startled face. Taking care not to get too close, she said, evenly, “I’m tired of paying you not to hurt me. This ends tonight.” The thief was shocked and scared. The thief, raising his hands, said pleadingly, “Don’t shoot me!” Eleanor had a keen suspicion regarding the thief’s identity. Evenly, she said, “Take off your mask. I want to see you before Sgt. Daniel arrives, which should be shortly as I speed dialed him before leaving my bedroom!” The thief removed his mask. Eleanor, still being very careful with her startled, unwanted guest, said simply, “I thought so!” It was barely two minutes before Sgt. Rick Daniel was standing in the small living room of Eleanor’s home. As he handcuffed the thief, he asked Eleanor if she was OK. “Oh, for heaven’s sake, yes!” was her reply. Rick Daniel chuckled, as he was aware of his elderly friend’s past. He asked, “Did you know who he was before he took his mask off?” “I was pretty certain,” was her answer. Rick smiled and asked her to explain. Who is the thief?
The thief is Zac Coulson. Eleanor was certain that the thief was Zac because he was the only one who would have been bullied by Marty Clayton. The thief, whoever he was, did not know whom he was dealing with. In her youth, Eleanor had traveled with a depression era gang of bank robbers. Her boyfriend had been killed in a shootout with J. Edgar Hoover’s G-Men and she had served several years in a Federal prison. Eleanor knew no fear and was no stranger to violence, but luckily for this punk who kept robbing her, she was far past her physical prime. As far as she could tell, the robber was one of four boys who lived nearby and whom, she knew, would be familiar with her house and personal habits. As she emptied her coffee cup, the contents of which did not sit well on her diseased stomach, Eleanor pondered the four boys seriously for the first time Todd Summers was the most violent and dangerous of the four. Todd had been in prison for armed robbery and assault. He was out on parole and considered by the local police to be very dangerous, for Todd, as Eleanor in her youth, knew no fear and enjoyed confrontation. Jon Shaw was dangerous only because he was feeble-minded and stupid. Jon looked up to the other tough guys in the neighborhood and had become their lackey. Jon was neither bright nor mean enough to commit serious crime, but he had been in and out of the local jail various times for minor offenses. Eleanor’s friend on the local police force, Sgt. Rick Daniel, often laughed and commented that, “the Shaw kid gets into trouble when he’s with his pals. He’s not smart enough to get into trouble on his own.” Next, Eleanor considered Max Reinke. She frowned as she considered what Max had given up. Max was well over six feet in height, a star basketball player on the local high school team and was headed to the state university on scholarship before he started getting into trouble. The word from her friend Sgt. Daniel was that his problems began when he developed a fondness for alcohol. Last on Eleanor’s suspect list was Zac Coulson. Eleanor knew Zac’s mother and was aware of how broken-hearted she was on her son becoming a thug and overall ne’er-do well. Zac was very rude to all who knew him and a bully to boot. He was always picking on younger, smaller boys and teasing little girls. Eleanor smiled as she remembered the day Marty Clayton caught up with him in her front yard.

Uncle Robert is buried in grave no. 4, under the tree.
The key to this is the dates. The oldest graves are in the corner farthest from the church. The grave between the man who died in 1860 and the woman who died in 1872 is an unmarked grave. So it is not grave no. 3.
The graves around the unmarked grave in the corner nearest the church are of persons of prominence, so it is not grave no. 4.
The graves around the unmarked grave in the Orphan’s Corner are of children, so it is not grave no. 5.
The graves around the unmarked grave in the corner nearest the church are of persons of prominence.

It is Ronald Finch.
Robert’s thoughts were on the mystery challenge as he entered the conference room for the next meeting. He greeted his colleagues with a smile and took his seat. “So, who’s it going to be?” asked Russell. “Well, I’ve given it a lot of thought,” said Robert. “I’ve narrowed it down to two of you.” “Really?” asked Edward. “Who?” asked Ronald. “It’s either you or Russell,” said Robert. “But I’m going to have to ask you to leave the room for a few minutes, Ronald, while I ask Russell a question.” Ronald left the room and Robert turned to Russell. “Did you give Jane a package to put in the vault?” “No, I did not,” answered Russell. “She was just waiting for me while I put a file in my own box.” “That’s what I thought,” said Robert. “That means it’s Ronald. He was the only one in the vault alone for a long time.” “You’re right,” said Russell. “He was in there a long time.” Ronald returned to the room and Robert said, “Ronald, it was you. I’m sure of it.” Ronald smiled. “You’re right, Robert. It was me. And I’ll tell you why. I was in there a long time because I was looking for the right box. I thought I was putting the item in box 100 but I was wrong. I put it in box 101. I left my name on a piece of paper with the item. You’ll have to open both boxes to find it. I’m sorry.” “That’s all right,” said Robert. “We’ll open both boxes and see who wins.” “And what was the item?” asked Russell. “A vanilla folder,” said Ronald. “I took it from Peter’s office. He’s always misplacing them and I figured he wouldn’t miss it.” “You’re right,” said Peter. “I wouldn’t have missed it.” Robert opened the vault and took out lockbox 101. He opened it and inside was a vanilla folder with a piece of paper on which Ronald had written his name. “Congratulations, Ronald,” said Robert. “You’ve won our first mystery challenge. You’re a good choice to come up with a mystery for our next meeting.”

Mike McCormick, Sr. was the founder of McCormick Plastics and had made his fortune in the years following World War II, when the nation’s appetite for all things plastic became insatiable. McCormick Plastics was a multi-billion dollar global corporation, and had been since the early 1960s. McCormick had offices and factories all over the world. McCormick had cherished the coins, and Ernestine sensed, or thought she sensed, that Mike was struggling to obtain them. She feared setting the coins out for him, lest he leave with them and not return. How a ghost would do this, she did not know. But his absence was something she dreaded. Every morning, Ernestine would survey the den. Sometimes, she could tell the room had been disturbed. Ernestine would not allow the maid to dust the den for this reason. One morning she had noticed the dust collecting on the gas cutoff feeding the fireplace. Near it, several magazines on the large coffee table had been strewn about the richly finished wood floor. Ernestine suspected the cause to be strong drafts drawn by the huge fireplace – or was it indeed Mike’s ghost thrashing about in frustration? Ernestine kept the “gas key,” which was the key to the disguised den wall safe, hanging on the wall upstairs. She learned long ago that Mike’s spirit would not come upstairs – or anywhere near her. Ernestine took the presence of Mike’s spirit seriously. The family mansion, which had been constructed in the late 1950s, still had the old-fashioned light switches it was originally built with. She kept these because of the loud click they made when flipped on or off. As far as she could recall, she had never heard a light switch go on or off in the middle of the night. She also refused to change the arrangement of furniture or the placement of pictures on the mansion’s many walls. In her mind, if it was Mike, she wanted him to feel at home. But nearing 100, Ernestine knew her senses could not be all that trustworthy. She asked herself often: Is Mike truly with me, or is it an old lady’s wishful thinking? All of this ran through Ernestine’s mind as she lay silently in bed. The next day, Michael and Connie were the first to arrive in the middle of the morning. Their children, Casey and Ellen, arrived early in the afternoon. The McCormick family was not just any family. The late Mike McCormick, Sr. was the founder of McCormick Plastics and had made his fortune in the years following World War II, when the nation’s appetite for all things plastic became insatiable. McCormick Plastics was a multi-billion dollar global corporation, and had been since the early 1960s. McCormick had offices and factories all over the world. Michael, Jr. and his brothers held key posts with the corporation. By the middle of the afternoon, Mama Ernestine, as she was called, was holding court in the dining room. A light lunch was being catered and she was up for the occasion. She was in excellent health physically and had lost none of her formidable mental faculties. As the family sat around the table, she silently took stock of those she loved dearly. Sadly, she reflected that her 65-year-old son, Michael, appeared to be in poor health. Michael was at least 40 pounds overweight and in the early stages of emphysema, caused by many years of smoking. He was chronically nearsighted and wore glasses so thick the lenses appeared to be coke bottle bottoms. As if reading his mother’s mind, he said, “I can see OK with the glasses, but cannot see well in the dark anymore, even with them on. I don’t know what we would do without our driver.” Ernestine smiled and kept her concerns to herself. She asked daughter-in-law, Connie, how she was doing. Connie had suffered polio in the 1950s epidemic and one leg was shorter than the other. She walked unevenly and with the help of a cane an elevated shoe. Connie replied, “I’m getting along OK, but the doc tells me to wear hard soled and heeled shoes at all times to avoid bone spurs.” Connie laughed, “This big shoe feels like a bowling ball sometimes but I’m not complaining. At least I can get around.” Ernestine nodded. Connie’s ability to laugh at herself was something she admired very much. She turned to Casey, her 36-year-old grandson. Casey was the free spirit in the family and it showed today. Casey had arrived at the McCormick house wearing a tank top, baggy military fatigue trousers and heavy soled boots. He had a small plastic bag with a change of socks and underwear. That was all he brought with him. Ernestine teased him, “Are you a Rambo wannabe?” The good natured Casey grinned back at her and said, “I suppose so.” Next, Ernestine surveyed Ellen. Ellen was 29 and an accomplished ballet dancer. Ernestine figured there was no way she could weigh more than 90 pounds. Ernestine considered that she would have made an excellent spy or cat burglar. She was able to appear and disappear unnoticed, so graceful and quiet were her body movements. She asked Ellen, “How is the dancing going?” “It’s going great, Mama. I’ve been able to raise several thousand dollars for the McCormick Foundation since last time I saw you.” Ernestine was fiercely proud of her granddaughter. She motioned for her to come closer. She kissed Ellen on the cheek and said, “Dear, I’m so proud of you! Keep up the good work.” The family had a wonderful visit over the late lunch. A light dinner and birthday cake would be enjoyed later. Before retiring for an afternoon nap, Ernestine decided it was time to tell them of her suspicions concerning their grandfather’s ghost. “Now, all of you will think this is the rambling of an old lady. Maybe it is, but hear me out. You’ve heard me speak of your grandfather’s African coins. We even showed them to you once when you younger ones were kids. Well, they are not in a safety deposit box like we told you – they are in a hidden safe in the den. The keyhole for the fireplace gas valve in the den is really the lock to the safe. That’s where the coins are. Several times a week … most nights, really, I hear noises down there, as if your grandfather is trying to get to the safe. Everyone was polite enough not to scoff at Mama Ernestine’s story. That night, they enjoyed Mama’s party. Everyone was in bed by 11:00 p.m. Sure enough, around 2:00 a.m., Ernestine heard noises in the night, only this time they were different. She heard the faint creaking of a door and felt the quiet and steady -- but heavy -- footsteps on the hardwood floors. She thought she heard the clicking of metal on metal downstairs. Ernestine didn’t know what to think and did not sleep the remainder of the night. In the morning, upon inspection of the den and wall safe, her fears were confirmed. Sitting on the sofa and pondering the situation for a few minutes, she realized what had happened: Someone had stolen the gold coins. With great agitation, she called the family together before breakfast. She held her temper long enough to explain what happened and, showing them the empty wall safe, said, “I know who did this.” Pointing to the guilty person, she said, heatedly, “Shame on you! Why did you do this?” Who stole the gold coins?
Answer: It was Casey. He was the only one who could reach the safe. He was also the only one who could lift the safe door. The other family members were too short.

The culprit is Archibald Hopkins.
In his statement, Robert Bannington said that he was introduced to the Countess by Archibald Hopkins. Archibald Hopkins said that he had only a brief dance with the Countess, and then left her. But when the Countess was talking with Loralie Courtney, she said that Archibald Hopkins came over to her and Loralie Courtney, and then he joined them in talking about the pearls.
This means that Archibald Hopkins lied in his statement, and that he was with the Countess for longer than he said he was.
This means that he was close enough to the Countess to unclasp her pearls, and drop them into the palm tree pot.
The Countess was not wearing the pearls when she was talking with Loralie Courtney. This means that she had already lost them, and that Archibald Hopkins had already dropped them into the palm tree pot.
So Archibald Hopkins is the culprit.

Riddle #2: The Hidden Treasure
A pirate once hid a treasure chest.
It’s buried on an island in the West.
The pirate, who was very smart,
Wrote a clue on where the treasure chart
Was hidden. He wanted to be sure
That only someone very clever
Would find the treasure. He knew
That it would be hard to find the clue.
He knew that only a smart kid
Would find the treasure map he hid.
The pirate wrote a poem about
Where he hid the map. If you read out
The poem, you will find the place
Where the map is hidden. You must race
To find the treasure before anyone
Can beat you to it. Have some fun!

You have to think step-by-step.
The thief is the photographer.
Doug and Jimmie were stunned. The photographer had been sitting beside the cash register all day, and so he had the perfect opportunity to steal the money. He was also the only person who knew how much money had been stolen. Doug had noticed that the photographer was the only person who wasn't smiling. He was tired of taking pictures of smiling children, and he was tired of working for Mr. Corrigan. Mrs. Martin had already told them that the photographer was angry with Mr. Corrigan for not paying him enough. The police officer was happy to hear Doug's explanation, and he shook Doug's hand. "You're a smart elf!" he said. "You've got a bright future ahead of you!" Doug was happy to hear the compliment, and he was proud that he'd helped to catch a thief. But he was still annoyed that he had to spend the rest of his day in a green elf costume. He had to admit that he was relieved when his shift finally ended. He had to admit, too, that he was relieved to take off his elf costume. He had to admit, finally, that he was relieved that he'd never have to wear that silly green costume again. But Jimmie, as usual, had a different attitude. He was disappointed that he'd never get to wear the elf costume again. "I'm going to miss being an elf!" he sighed. "It's the best job I've ever had!"

Tom Jenks.
He was bound for Gander, Newfoundland, but he was arrested at Heathrow Airport.
Now, Heathrow Airport is located in London, England.
The distance between London and Gander is 2,940 miles.
But, the distance between Gander and New York City is only 1,122 miles.
So, why was he going to Gander to get to New York City?
The answer is that he was going to Gander to get the money, which was dropped 5 hours into the flight from New York City to Liverpool.
The distance between Gander and Liverpool is 2,000 miles, which is exactly 5 hours of flight time at 200 mph.
The money was dropped somewhere between Gander and Liverpool.
The Flying Bandit would have to pass through Gander on his way back to New York City in order to retrieve the money.
But, the other three men did not have to pass through Gander to get back to the United States.
Therefore, Tom Jenks is the culprit.

Answer: Milton is the culprit.

The other three teenagers don't know how many tickets in the cashbox. They just know the number of tickets in the cashbox is less than 50. Therefore, Milton is the culprit.

The intruder is Kirsten.
Kirsten’s key has dust on it because she is the only one who has not visited the house.
The silk handkerchief was a clue, but not a very good one.
The only person who could have heard the car turning around in the driveway was the person in the house, not the person in the car.
The intruder was frightened by the noise of the car pulling in and out of the driveway.
The intruder was in the house when the telephone rang and it was the telephone that startled the intruder, not the noise Steven made in the closet.
The intruder was frightened by the telephone ringing and ran out of the house without returning the key to the keyboard.
The intruder had to be the one who was in the house when the telephone rang and the one who had not visited the house.
The intruder was Kirsten.
Kirsten was searching for the “treasure” because she is the only one who did not know what it was.
The “treasure” was the key to her room.
The reason for the keys being hung incorrectly was to alert Steven that someone was searching for something.
Steven had hidden the key to Kirsten’s room because she was the only child who had not yet visited the house.

But she had a private cottage by the lake, and she meant that. She buried it there, in her private cottage. The police searched for holes in the ground, but they didn’t think to search for holes in the walls. That’s where she buried it—in a wall of her cottage.

## 5minutemystery-the-trick-or-treat-mystery

The culprit is Dorothy.
The clues are in the story.
The first clue is in the first paragraph:
“Ed and Ellen McAnn lived in a semi-rural area. There were rows of houses on both sides of the street but, once you left the small neighborhood they had lived in for almost ten years, you had to travel over a mile to get to the next populated suburb.”
The second clue is in the second paragraph:
“Ed, a detective with the City Police Department, never could figure out why this was the way it was. But, on this night, he didn’t care.”
The third clue is in the third paragraph:
“The evening was crystal clear and beautiful. The moon was shining bright above their home, which sat on the north side of a street which ran east and west. In their neighborhood where there were few trees, there was more than ample lighting for children walking over lawns and across public streets. Ed and Ellen’s daughter Crystal brought their grandsons over just after dark. She didn’t see Crystal pull her car into the driveway, as it sat to the extreme west of the property and out of view of the front door.”
The fourth clue is in the fourth paragraph:
“Ed opened the garage door to leave for work, he noticed something propped up on the driveway, close to the door and blocking his exit. It was a small model tombstone, which bore the inscription: Few treats in this house, I fear; Tricks to all who live here! Beside the tombstone, there were a couple of broken eggs that created a small but inconvenient mess to clean up. The garage doors sat several feet back from the front of the house and anyone wishing to pull a prank by the door would do so unnoticed.”
The fifth clue is in the fifth paragraph:
“After assisting Ellen with the cleanup, he told her they would discuss it after he returned from work. That night, Ed and Ellen relaxed after dinner. He said, “Tell me about last night.” Ellen answered, “We only had five kids come to the door. I’d like to know which one pulled the “trick” on us. I recognized all of them and would like to call the parents.” Ed said, “Keep talking.” “Well, the first child, dressed as a witch, hurriedly appeared from the direction of the Smiths, our neighbors to the east and left going towards our neighbors to the west. After listening for the traditional “Trick or Treat,” I dropped a mint into the witch’s brew pot and the child skipped away. I was a little concerned for the witch because her costume was so baggy and loose fitting that I feared she would trip and hurt herself.” “Next came the lion. He was very small and with his father. After thanking me I saw them head toward the Smith home. They didn’t seem unhappy with the small treat.” “A little while later the ghost appeared. The ghost was very real looking in the moonlight as the slight breeze kept blowing the sheet, which served as the costume. The ghost came from the direction of the driveway and headed east after thanking me for the starlight mint.” Ellen continued as Ed intently listened. “Next came Superman. This boy was a little older and the tight fitting costume showed off a developing, muscular physique. He didn’t seem unhappy with his treat, either.” “Last was Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz. Before leaving our door, her little dog, dressed as Toto, ran into the street to chase a rabbit in the moonlight. I went outside to make certain everything was OK. ‘Dorothy’ didn’t retrieve her dog until they were several houses up the street.” Which direction did they go? ” “West.” Ed thought a minute and smiled. He said to his wife, “You think you know who all of the five children were? “Yes, I’m certain of it. I know them all from volunteering at the school.” “Good. I know whose parents you need to call.” Who created the mess?

gen('\nThe culprit is Dorothy.\nThe clues are in the story.\nThe first clue is in the first paragraph:\n“Ed and Ellen McAnn lived in a semi-rural area. There were rows of houses on both sides of the street but, once you left the small neighborhood they had lived in for almost ten years, you had to travel over a mile to get to the next populated suburb.”\nThe second clue is in the second paragraph:\n“Ed, a detective with the City Police Department, never could figure out why this was the way it was. But, on this night, he didn’t care.”\nThe third clue is in the third paragraph:\n“The evening was crystal clear and beautiful. The moon was shining bright above their home, which sat on the north side of a street which ran east and west. In their neighborhood where there were few trees, there was more than ample lighting for children walking over lawns and across public streets. Ed and Ellen’s daughter Crystal brought their grandsons over just after dark. She didn’t see Crystal pull her car into the driveway, as it sat to the extreme west of the property and out of view of the front door.”\nThe fourth clue is in the fourth paragraph:\n“Ed opened the garage door to leave for work, he noticed something propped up on the driveway, close to the door and blocking his exit. It was a small model tombstone, which bore the inscription: Few treats in this house, I fear; Tricks to all who live here! Beside the tombstone, there were a couple of broken eggs that created a small but inconvenient mess to clean up. The garage doors sat several feet back from the front of the house and anyone wishing to pull a prank by the door would do so unnoticed.”\nThe fifth clue is in the fifth paragraph:\n“After assisting Ellen with the cleanup, he told her they would discuss it after he returned from work. That night, Ed and Ellen relaxed after dinner. He said, “Tell me about last night.” Ellen answered, “We only had five kids come to the door. I’d like to know which one pulled the “trick” on us. I recognized all of them and would like to call the parents.” Ed said, “Keep talking.” “Well, the first child, dressed as a witch, hurriedly appeared from the direction of the Smiths, our neighbors to the east and left going towards our neighbors to the west. After listening for the traditional “Trick or Treat,” I dropped a mint into the witch’s brew pot and the child skipped away. I was a little concerned for the witch because her costume was so baggy and loose fitting that I feared she would trip and hurt herself.” “Next came the lion. He was very small and with his father. After thanking me I saw them head toward the Smith home. They didn’t seem unhappy with the small treat.” “A little while later the ghost appeared. The ghost was very real looking in the moonlight as the slight breeze kept blowing the sheet, which served as the costume. The ghost came from the direction of the driveway and headed east after thanking me for the starlight mint.” Ellen continued as Ed intently listened. “Next came Superman. This boy was a little older and the tight fitting costume showed off a developing, muscular physique. He didn’t seem unhappy with his treat, either.” “Last was Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz. Before leaving our door, her little dog, dressed as Toto, ran into the street to chase a rabbit in the moonlight. I went outside to make certain everything was OK. ‘Dorothy’ didn’t retrieve her dog until they were several houses up the street.” Which direction did they go? ” “West.” Ed thought a minute and smiled. He said to his wife, “You think you know who all of the five children were? “Yes, I’m certain of it. I know them all from volunteering at the school.” “Good. I know whose parents you need to call.” Who created the mess?\nThe first clue tells us that the McAnn’s house is in a semi-rural area.

The culprit is the balloon twister. When the mime was asked if he took the dog, he didn’t say anything, because he was a mime. When the stilt-walker was asked, he said, “That dog? No. What use would I have for such a small dog?” The living statue was asked, and he said, “The living statue, I presume?” and he didn’t answer the question. The balloon twister was asked, and she shrugged. The mime and the living statue didn’t answer because they were mute. The stilt-walker didn’t answer because he was too high up. The balloon twister didn’t answer because she couldn’t speak while blowing up a balloon.

### Solution

The answer is Ed the Bludgeoner.

Here is the solution.

Professor Moriarty's plan was to have one of the four men kill Holmes, and then kill the man he had hired to do the job. The idea was to have no witnesses to the murder, and to have a fall guy.

The first man, Ed the Bludgeoner, is not the killer because Professor Moriarty would have to kill him in order to keep him quiet.

The second man, Herman Houlihan, is not the killer because Professor Moriarty would have to kill him in order to keep him quiet.

The third man, Fastidious Fred Fielder, is not the killer because Professor Moriarty would have to kill him in order to keep him quiet.

The fourth man, Morris the Ascot Dandy, is not the killer because Professor Moriarty would have to kill him in order to keep him quiet.

The only person who could kill Holmes and not be killed in return by Professor Moriarty is Ed the Bludgeoner.

Professor Moriarty could kill the other three men because he would be able to say that they were hired to kill Holmes. He would have no motive for killing Ed the Bludgeoner, because Ed the Bludgeoner did not kill Holmes.

Crusher Davis knew that the names given him in these emails were not real. That was all right with him. He also disguised in his column what he was told somewhat, in order not to embarrass people. That was just playing the game. The important thing was the advice and helping people. Well, Jimmy’s girlfriend had returned a present that he had bought at Craft’s Jewelry Store for her birthday. It was a nice broach, the first jewelry he had ever bought, and it had cost him $20 on sale. Jimmy was really upset. The broach that she had worn at their last date was a swan, actually very nice. Jimmy had seen it at the same jewelry store and decided not to buy it. He remembered it had cost $40 when he had gone birthday shopping for her. He asked her what had happened and she got all red and then admitted that she had returned the other broach and gotten a credit for it, which really was almost as good as Jimmy buying this one in the first place. She even showed him the receipt. “My foot!” Davis said. “That’s so inconsiderate. If he sticks with her, some divorce lawyer is going to collect some serious money in not too many years, that’s for sure.” He made some notes for his column and then turned to the second email. This was from Linda, and she had a different problem. Her boyfriend forgot about her birthday entirely. He had made it worse by pretending that he had remembered it all the time. They had met for lunch and she was not a happy camper. He figured out why she was sad before she blurted it out, Linda gave him that. He then gave her this big line that she wanted to believe about his leaving her present on the counter of Mason’s Department Store. Just excuse him for a minute or two, and he’d make matters right. He could certainly talk nicely when he wanted to, Linda wrote, which was usually when he was in trouble. Maybe he was good at sweet-talking because he so often needed to be! Anyway, it wasn’t ten minutes before he returned with a package in a bag from Mason’s Department Store. And inside the bag was a very nice bathing suit - the wrong size! Crusher Davis grinned. “He’s hopeless, that’s for sure. She’ll have some hard times with him. But maybe it’ll be worth it in the long run. He did after all try to correct his blunder, even if he told her a white lie while doing so.” The third email was from a fellow named Walt that Davis was sure he knew, since he wrote that he worked as a ticket seller at the Acme Movie Complex. It seems that when Walt came on duty, after the bargain late afternoon movie, he had found a bag in the ticket seller’s booth. He asked Sam, ticket seller at the bargain movie, about it. One of Sam’s duties was to clean up the theater after each performance, a chore Sam hated. You were always getting a handful of used chewing gum, for one thing. Sam told him that a pretty girl he knew only slightly from high school had been so caught up in the movie that when she left the theater, she had left a paper bag on her seat. Sam had put it in the booth for safekeeping while he cleaned up the theater. Well, Walt wrote that the bag contained eight DVDs - they were unmarked, but probably came from the Jones Movie Rental Shop, since it was the only one in town. He didn’t know if they had been stolen or not, and he didn’t want to get this girl into trouble. Neither did he want to help a thief. What should he do? “Well, Sam, you’re probably the one in trouble now,” Davis thought. ”You should have returned them to her immediately. That is, if you saw her with the package when she came into the theater. Or if you weren’t sure, you should have returned them to the Jones Movie Rental Ship and let them handle it. Be decisive, man!” The fourth email was from Lester, and he also had problems. His girlfriend was color-blind and wouldn’t admit it. Not that there was anything wrong in that, but she had gotten him a sweater that was the most awful shade of deep orange he had ever seen. She liked it and said that the salesgirl had assured her that the present would make a big hit. But Lester hated it. He could just imagine the kidding the other guys were going to give him when he wore the sweater, if he had to do so. She said she had thrown away the receipt. Lester thought she said this because she clearly didn’t want him to return the sweater. What did Martha think - could he return it? “Well, you either turn in the girl friend or the sweater, my friend,” Davis thought. Then he began to think harder about the problems. Who was really involved here? It was a small town, and he knew everybody. Part time coaching at Centerville High made that a sure thing. Let’s take stock. Well, for one thing, there was only one color-blind girl at Centerville High, and that was Martha Hampden. The smooth talker that Linda was dating had to be Steve Kravitz. Jimmy Bean was writing about Jane Croydon, for sure. She was always looking over her shoulder for a better date. He could just imagine her at the jewelry store swapping the broach. He thought of Walt’s email. Davis couldn’t imagine whom Sam had in mind, the girl at the movie. But Sam was Johnny Martin. He was a loner, hard to approach. In fact, Davis had been at the bargain late afternoon movie, which was very lightly attended and had seen him on duty. In fact, Johnny Martin had sold him his ticket. Davis was jotting a few notes when his friend Inspector Samuels came into the Tastee Diner. “Thought I’d see you here, Crusher. I wonder if you could give me a hand with this problem of shoplifting. There’s been a regular outbreak recently, and I spent most of the morning talking with businessmen on Main Street. Also it’s quite touchy, since nobody wants to make a false accusation, and ruin some youngster’s reputation.” “Sure, Inspector. What do they tell you?” “Well, at Craft’s Jewelry Store, they are missing a nice broach, that had been on sale. The last sales records show that Jane Croydon had brought in a broach last week, a different one, but they remember that she had looked closely at the missing one. It just seemed suspicious at the time. The trouble was that the sales clerk is new and doesn’t always get the sales receipts done properly. “Then at Mason’s Department Store, there has been a problem with their on sale counter. It is close to the door, and not all of those for sale items have security tags on them - you know, those devices that go off whenever someone tries to sneak an item out the front door. The routine is for customers to take their items across the aisle, where a clerk will bag the purchase and write up the sale. But that doesn’t always happen as it should. “And over at the Jones Movie Rental Shop, some employee has been ripping off the company, stealing DVDs and removing the sleeve identification that shows where they come from. They are pretty sure whom it is, but they don’t know who has been taking the DVDs out of the store. “All that sounds like quite a crime wave for Centerville, Inspector. But I can tell you one thing. Once I tell you what I’ve learned as Ask Martha, one shoplifting at least will be solved.” Who is the thief?
The culprit is Steve Kravitz.
The thief is Jane Croydon.
The culprit is Johnny Martin.
The thief is Lester.
The culprit is Martha Hampden.
The suspects are Jane Croydon,Johnny Martin,Martha Hampden,Steve Kravitz
gen('\nCrusher Davis knew that the names given him in these emails were not real. That was all right with him. He also disguised in his column what he was told somewhat, in order not to embarrass people. That was just playing the game. The important thing was the advice and helping people. Well, Jimmy’s girlfriend had returned a present that he had bought at Craft’s Jewelry Store for her birthday. It was a nice broach, the first jewelry he had ever bought, and it had cost him $20 on sale. Jimmy was really upset. The broach that she had worn at their last date was a swan, actually very nice. Jimmy had seen it at the same jewelry store and decided not to buy it. He remembered it had cost $40 when he had gone birthday shopping for her. He asked her what had happened and she got all red and then admitted that she had returned the other broach and gotten a credit for it, which really was almost as good as Jimmy buying this one in the first place. She even showed him the receipt. “My foot!” Davis said. “That’s so inconsiderate. If he sticks with her, some divorce lawyer is going to collect some serious money in not too many years, that’s for sure.” He made some notes for his column and then turned to the second email. This was from Linda, and she had a different problem. Her boyfriend forgot about her birthday entirely. He had made it worse by pretending that he had remembered it all the time. They had met for lunch and she was not a happy camper. He figured out why she was sad before she blurted it out, Linda gave him that. He then gave her this big line that she wanted to believe about his leaving her present on the counter of Mason’s Department Store. Just excuse him for a minute or two, and he’d make matters right. He could certainly talk nicely when he wanted to, Linda wrote, which was usually when he was in trouble. Maybe he was good at sweet-talking because he so often needed to be! Anyway, it wasn’t ten minutes before he returned with a package in a bag from Mason’s Department Store. And inside the bag was a very nice bathing suit - the wrong size! Crusher Davis grinned. “He’s hopeless, that’s for sure. She’ll have some hard times with him. But maybe it’ll be worth it in the long run. He did after all try to correct his blunder, even if he told her a white lie while doing so.” The third email was from a fellow named Walt that Davis was sure he knew, since he wrote that he worked as a ticket seller at the Acme Movie Complex. It seems that when Walt came on duty, after the bargain late afternoon movie, he had found a bag in the ticket seller’s booth. He asked Sam, ticket seller at the bargain movie, about it. One of Sam’s duties was to clean up the theater after each performance, a chore Sam hated. You were always getting a handful of used chewing gum, for one thing. Sam told him that a pretty girl he knew only slightly from high school had been so caught up in the movie that when she left the theater, she had left a paper bag on her seat. Sam had put it in the booth for safekeeping while he cleaned up the theater. Well, Walt wrote that the bag contained eight DVDs - they were unmarked, but probably came from the Jones Movie Rental Shop, since it was the only one in town. He didn’t know if they had been stolen or not, and he didn’t want to get this girl into trouble. Neither did he want to help a thief. What should he do? “Well, Sam, you’re probably the one in trouble now,” Davis thought. ”You should have returned them to her immediately. That is, if you saw her with the package when she came into the theater. Or if you weren’t sure, you should have returned them to the Jones Movie Rental Ship and let them handle it. Be decisive, man!” The fourth email was from Lester, and he also had problems. His girlfriend was color-blind and wouldn’t admit it. Not that there was anything wrong in that, but she had gotten him a sweater that was the most awful shade of deep orange he had ever seen. She liked it and said that the salesgirl had assured her that the present would make a big hit. But Lester hated it. He could just imagine the kidding the other guys were going to give him when he wore the sweater, if he had to do so. She said she had thrown away the receipt. Lester thought she said this because she clearly didn’t want him to return the sweater. What did Martha think - could he return it? “Well, you either turn in the girl friend or the sweater, my friend,” Davis thought. Then he began to think harder about the problems. Who was really involved here? It was a small town, and he knew everybody. Part time coaching at Centerville High made that a sure thing. Let’s take stock.

First of all, we know that the painting was stolen by one of the four beneficiaries. It is not the uncle, as he was in bed. It is not Daisy, as she had to get up to take her tablets. It is not Iain, as he was injured and was nursing his leg. That leaves Dale and Lucy. We know that Lucy screamed when she saw the dummy. She was the first to see it, so it is unlikely that she put it there. We also know that Dale has poor vision, so it is unlikely that he put the dummy there. Therefore, Dale must have stolen the painting.

The fourth letter came from Horace Osamway. He is the culprit. The fifth letter came from Mildred Greene. She is the culprit.
Melissa Jones was acquitted of her husband’s murder. However, she was the one who lied under oath. She testified that she had called the police immediately after her husband had died, and that it had been about eight o’clock. However, Martha Cranston testified that she had passed by the Jones house about six o’clock and that she had heard a big argument going on, something about ‘losing the house,’ and whose fault that was. She tried to tune it out, as a devoted churchgoer, because of the real atomic-submarine-class profanity that was being used, but it wasn’t possible. What really riled her was that when she returned from the store and passed the Jones house once again, an hour and a half later, the argument was still going on, and was just as intense as it had been earlier. They were even using some of the same—shall we say colorful—expressions that had been shouted earlier! The argument had been going on for about an hour and a half, and she heard it for about an hour and a half. It is reasonable to conclude that she heard the argument from about six o’clock to about seven thirty, and that the argument had been going on for about an hour and a half before she heard it, which would mean that the argument had started at about five o’clock. This means that Melissa Jones lied when she said that she had called the police immediately after her husband had died, and that it had been about eight o’clock. She had called the police about an hour and a half after her husband had died.
The suspects are Horace Osamway,John Eberley,Martha Cranston,Mildred Greene

The police officer is the culprit. He stole Gorg's gold record.
When the police officer first arrived, he said, "I guess after that, he's entitled to his privacy." He didn't seem to care much either way. But when we got to Gorg's place, all we saw was an enormous brick wall. We stared silently as Lenny continued driving along the wall, which seemed like it never ended. "I think I saw one of his records at a garage sale Saturday," Lenny said. "He was dressed up like a lizard."
This shows that the police officer has been to Gorg's house before.

Solution to The Mystery of the Arsonist
The culprit is Scared Stiff.
Minding My Own Business had seen the arsonist leave the drug store on March 4, when the fire was set. The arsonist had been seen leaving the Bradley Men’s Store on March 11, when that fire was set. Scared Stiff said that she saw the arsonist running out the front door of Bradley Men’s Store on March 11. If she had seen the arsonist, why would she be scared? She would have seen the arsonist running away from the scene of the crime. She would have had no reason to fear for her safety. Since she said she was scared, she must have been the arsonist, running away from the scene of the crime.

Asked by: Kumudini Kumarasinghe
The culprit is Claire. She said that she was at the computer store at the time of the murder, but she didn't say she bought a computer. She could have gone to the store, then returned home, murdered her husband, and then returned to the store. The store clerk would have no reason to remember her, as she didn't buy anything. She could have returned home after the murder, and then met up with her sister at the mall.
This is a trick question. The answer is Alex. He said that he came through the back door, but he couldn't have because it was locked. He had to have had a key to get in, and Jack would only have given a key to someone he trusted.

Here is the answer. The murderer is Watson.
1. Watson said, “I poured the coffee into the cups. I noticed what I believed to be an inch of standing water in one of them by the tray’s edge. I remember this because it was a bit fuller than the others after I poured and I was concerned that the server would splash it on his shirt. I didn’t think anything more of it, other than I thought it would help to cool the hot coffee. Besides, I didn’t serve the coffee. Johnny did.”

10. Al said, “I had on a short sleeve shirt and slacks. I’m always warm, so the cold felt good.”
11. Johnny said, “As you recall, that morning we gathered early for our upgrade. I arrived first to unlock the computer room and cabinets.”
12. Johnny said, “I would have had one of you do that, but back then only managers carried keys.”
13. Johnny said, “Recall also that our whole team was involved in it, as it was 1981 and one of the first major IT upgrades.”
14. Johnny said, “By 1:45 p.m. or so, all was going well and we had the television on. Reagan had been shot at about 1:30 p.m. central time, and news of this was on all of the major channels.”
15. Johnny said, “It provided enough distraction to give the killer an excellent opportunity to lace Eddie’s cup of coffee with poison.”
16. Johnny said, “As I recall, Eddie drank the fateful swallow as we watched video clips of the shooting.”
17. Johnny said, “The killer left the half empty bottle of poison in a cabinet drawer -- it was a huge bottle, not easily concealed, and I didn’t retrieve it until a couple of months later.”

19. Johnny said, “I don’t want to finger the killer until we talk this out.”

21. Al said, “Who had the poison and when was it slipped into Eddie’s coffee?”
22. Johnny said, “Let’s continue. Watson and I wore lab coats in the computer room to say warm. We could have easily hid a bottle in our jackets.”

“He says, like Concerned Neighbor, that the problem behind the littering is the lack of proper police protection. But he offers a different solution. Hire more police, he says, and the problem would be solved. He admits that it would also lower the community association dues he and others now have to pay for their own private protection, but he says that’s only fair. He is a taxpaying citizen like everyone else. That is a cause that Martha should explore, he adds. He says that he is neat as a pin himself, and can’t abide litter. It’s a real health and safety issue.”
“It’s Perplexed Dog Walker. This is probably an animal rights person, and the letter, unlike the first two, is handwritten. It looks like a woman’s handwriting. Anyway, she goes out and walks her dog whenever the dog needs to go—no waiting until the morning. She is writing because she actually saw the littering happen. It was along the route she walks her dog, along Elm as it leads into Maple. She saw litter being thrown out of the front window of a car, the driver’s side, and not just once, but repeatedly. “She admits that she is not always careful with her own trash, the odd chewing gum wrapper, that sort of thing. But this was large scale, and shocking. There was no way that it was not deliberate. She says it must have been about one o’clock in the morning or so. She signs herself Perplexed, because she can’t understand why anyone would do this. Like Concerned Neighbor, she wants Martha to advise her about forming a community association of some sort, to patrol the area. She adds that she has been thinking of selling her home, and the housing market is bad enough without some idiot lowering property values with this littering campaign.”
“The car was a full block away, and it was fairly dark out, so she didn’t get a good look.”
“It’s from Confused Commuter. This one is also handwritten, a man’s handwriting. The writer says that he and his wife came home late one night from our state capital, after watching their son play tournament basketball. Their son’s team had lost, so he was in a very bad mood. They stopped at a fast food restaurant on Route 12—you know, that strip just outside of town—for a late night snack. He writes that he saw someone in the back, behind the restaurant, stealing one of the garbage containers that had been taken out for emptying into the dumpster when the night shift changed. He wrote Martha because he said he didn’t want to get involved in a police matter. They went home immediately from the restaurant.”

Mystery Story 2
The following is a mystery story. You have to find out who is the culprit.
It was a cold, rainy day in early March. The kind of day that made you want to stay inside with a cup of hot cocoa and a good book. But not for me. I had a job to do. I was a private investigator, and I was on the trail of a killer. I had been hired by the family of the victim, a young woman named Sarah who had been found dead in her apartment. The police had ruled it a suicide, but the family was convinced that it was murder. And they were willing to pay me handsomely to find the truth. I started my investigation by talking to Sarah’s friends and family. I learned that she had been dating a man named John, who had been acting strangely since her death. He had been avoiding her friends and family, and had even moved out of his apartment without telling anyone. I decided to pay John a visit. When I arrived at his new apartment, I found him packing his belongings into a suitcase. He seemed nervous and agitated, and when I asked him about Sarah, he became even more uncomfortable. He told me that he had nothing to do with her death, but I wasn’t convinced. I decided to follow him, to see where he was going. He led me to a warehouse on the outskirts of town. I watched as he entered the building, and then I followed him inside. The warehouse was dark and empty, except for a single light bulb hanging from the ceiling. As I walked further into the building, I heard a noise coming from the shadows. I pulled out my gun and pointed it towards the sound. “Come out with your hands up!” I shouted. There was a moment of silence, and then a figure emerged from the shadows. It was John, and he was holding a gun. “Put your gun down,” I said. “I don’t want to hurt you.” John hesitated for a moment, and then he lowered his gun. “I didn’t kill Sarah,” he said. “I loved her. I would never have hurt her.” I believed him, but I still had questions. “Then why did you run away?” I asked. John sighed and rubbed his forehead. “I was scared,” he said. “I thought that the police would think I did it. I didn’t want to go to jail for something I didn’t do.” I nodded. “I understand,” I said. “But I need you to tell me everything you know about Sarah’s death. It could help us catch the real killer.” John agreed, and we spent the next few hours talking. He told me that Sarah had been acting strangely in the days leading up to her death. She had been receiving strange phone calls and emails, and she had been acting paranoid. John had tried to help her, but she had refused to tell him what was going on. I left the warehouse with a new lead. I started looking into Sarah’s emails and phone calls, and I found that she had been receiving threats from an unknown source. The threats had become more and more aggressive in the days leading up to her death. I also learned that Sarah had been working on a story for her newspaper about a local politician who was involved in a corruption scandal. I began to suspect that the politician was behind the threats, and that he had killed Sarah to keep her from exposing his crimes. I confronted the politician, and he confessed to everything. He had hired someone to kill Sarah, and he was willing to pay me a large sum of money to keep quiet. I refused his offer, and I turned him over to the police. The politician was arrested and charged with Sarah’s murder. I was able to bring some closure to Sarah’s family, and I was able to bring justice to a killer. But the case left me with one lingering question: why did Sarah’s boyfriend run away? He had nothing to do with her death, and he had no reason to run. I still don’t have an answer to that question, but I’m not giving up. I’ll keep investigating until I find the truth.
Mystery Story 3: The Missing Painting
The following is a mystery story. You have to find out who is the culprit. I hope you will enjoy the story.
It was a warm summer day in the small town of Willowbrook. The sun was shining, and the birds were singing. The town was bustling with activity as people went about their daily routines. But there was one person who was not enjoying the beautiful day. Her name was Emily, and she was the curator of the Willowbrook Art Museum. Emily had been working at the museum for over 10 years, and she loved her job. She was passionate about art, and she took great pride in the museum’s collection. But today, Emily was not feeling proud. In fact, she was feeling quite the opposite. Earlier that morning, she had discovered that one of the museum’s most prized possessions was missing. It was a painting by the famous artist Vincent van Gogh, and it was worth millions of dollars. Emily had no idea how the painting had gone missing, but she knew that she had to find it. She had been working at the museum for hours, searching through every nook and cranny, but she had found nothing. She was starting to feel hopeless. But then, Emily had an idea. She remembered that the museum had recently installed a new security system, and she wondered if it might have captured any footage of the theft. She rushed to the security room and began reviewing the footage. After hours of searching, she finally found what she was looking for. The footage showed a man dressed in all black, carrying the painting out of the museum. Emily was shocked. She had no idea who the man was, but she knew that she had to find him. She began searching for clues, and she soon discovered that the man had left behind a single fingerprint. Emily was determined to find the thief, and she knew that the fingerprint was her only hope. She contacted the police, and they began searching for the man. But they had no luck. The fingerprint did not match any of the known criminals in the area. Emily was starting to feel hopeless again. But then, she had another idea. She remembered that the museum had recently hired a new security guard, and she wondered if he might have seen anything. She contacted the security guard, and he told her that he had seen the man leaving the museum. He described the man’s appearance, and Emily realized that he was the same man from the security footage. But the security guard had no idea who the man was. Emily was starting to feel frustrated. She had no leads, and she was running out of time. But then, she had one last idea. She remembered that the museum had recently hosted a fundraising gala, and she wondered if the man had been there. She contacted the event planner, and she was able to get a list of all the attendees. Emily began searching through the list, and she soon found the man’s name. His name was John Smith, and he was a wealthy businessman from out of town. Emily was excited. She had finally found a lead. She contacted the police again, and they were able to track down John Smith. They brought him in for questioning, and he confessed to stealing the painting. He had been planning the theft for months, and he had used the fundraising gala as an opportunity to case the museum. Emily was relieved. The painting had been recovered, and the thief had been caught. She was proud of her work, and she knew that she had done her job well. But she also knew that she had been lucky. She had stumbled upon the clues that led her to the thief, and she knew that she could have easily missed them. She vowed to be more vigilant in the future, and she promised herself that she would never let anything like this happen again.

He told me that he had nothing to do with her death, but I wasn’t convinced. I decided to follow him, to see where he was going. He led me to a warehouse on the outskirts of town. I watched as he entered the building, and then I followed him inside. The warehouse was dark and empty, except for a single light bulb hanging from the ceiling. As I walked further into the building, I heard a noise coming from the shadows. I pulled out my gun and pointed it towards the sound. “Come out with your hands up!” I shouted. There was a moment of silence, and then a figure emerged from the shadows. It was John, and he was holding a gun. “Put your gun down,” I said. “I don’t want to hurt you.” John hesitated for a moment, and then he lowered his gun. “I didn’t kill Sarah,” he said. “I loved her. I would never have hurt her.” I believed him, but I still had questions. “Then why did you run away?” I asked. John sighed and rubbed his forehead. “I was scared,” he said. “I thought that the police would think I did it. I didn’t want to go to jail for something I didn’t do.” I nodded. “I understand,” I said. “But I need you to tell me everything you know about Sarah’s death. It could help us catch the real killer.” John agreed, and we spent the next few hours talking. He told me that Sarah had been acting strangely in the days leading up to her death. She had been receiving strange phone calls and emails, and she had been acting paranoid. John had tried to help her, but she had refused to tell him what was going on. I left the warehouse with a new lead. I started looking into Sarah’s emails and phone calls, and I found that she had been receiving threats from an unknown source. The threats had become more and more aggressive in the days leading up to her death. I also learned that Sarah had been working on a story for her newspaper about a local politician who was involved in a corruption scandal. I began to suspect that the politician was behind the threats, and that he had killed Sarah to keep her from exposing his crimes. I confronted the politician, and he confessed to everything. He had hired someone to kill Sarah, and he was willing to pay me a large sum of money to keep quiet. I refused his offer, and I turned him over to the police. The politician was arrested and charged with Sarah’s murder. I was able to bring some closure to Sarah’s family, and I was able to bring justice to a killer. But the case left me with one lingering question: why did Sarah’s boyfriend run away? He had nothing to do with her death, and he had no reason to run. I still don’t have an answer to that question, but I’m not giving up. I’ll keep investigating until I find the truth.\nMystery Story 3: The Missing Painting\nThe following is a mystery story.

The town was bustling with activity as people went about their daily routines. But there was one person who was not enjoying the beautiful day.

She was passionate about art, and she took great pride in the museum’s collection. But today, Emily was not feeling proud. In fact, she was feeling quite the opposite. Earlier that morning, she had discovered that one of the museum’s most prized possessions was missing. It was a painting by the famous artist Vincent van Gogh, and it was worth millions of dollars. Emily had no idea how the painting had gone missing, but she knew that she had to find it. She had been working at the museum for hours, searching through every nook and cranny, but she had found nothing. She was starting to feel hopeless. But then, Emily had an idea. She remembered that the museum had recently installed a new security system, and she wondered if it might have captured any footage of the theft. She rushed to the security room and began reviewing the footage. After hours of searching, she finally found what she was looking for. The footage showed a man dressed in all black, carrying the painting out of the museum. Emily was shocked. She had no idea who the man was, but she knew that she had to find him. She began searching for clues, and she soon discovered that the man had left behind a single fingerprint. Emily was determined to find the thief, and she knew that the fingerprint was her only hope. She contacted the police, and they began searching for the man. But they had no luck. The fingerprint did not match any of the known criminals in the area. Emily was starting to feel hopeless again. But then, she had another idea. She remembered that the museum had recently hired a new security guard, and she wondered if he might have seen anything. She contacted the security guard, and he told her that he had seen the man leaving the museum. He described the man’s appearance, and Emily realized that he was the same man from the security footage. But the security guard had no idea who the man was. Emily was starting to feel frustrated. She had no leads, and she was running out of time. But then, she had one last idea. She remembered that the museum had recently hosted a fundraising gala, and she wondered if the man had been there. She contacted the event planner, and she was able to get a list of all the attendees. Emily began searching through the list, and she soon found the man’s name. His name was John Smith, and he was a wealthy businessman from out of town. Emily was excited. She had finally found a lead. She contacted the police again, and they were able to track down John Smith. They brought him in for questioning, and he confessed to stealing the painting. He had been planning the theft for months, and he had used the fundraising gala as an opportunity to case the museum. Emily was relieved. The painting had been recovered, and the thief had been caught. She was proud of her work, and she knew that she had done her job well. But she also knew that she had been lucky. She had stumbled upon the clues that led her to the thief, and she knew that she could have easily missed them. She vowed to be more vigilant in the future, and she promised herself that she would never let anything like this happen again.\nMystery Story 4: The Missing Child\nThe following is a mystery story.

## 16. The Case of the Missing Patient

Here is a mystery story. Your role is to find who is the culprit.

I was waiting in the office of Dr. Robert C. Crawford. I was waiting for the results of my annual physical examination. It was a tense moment. I had been a patient of Crawford for years. He was a tall, well-built man in his late 50s, and a well-known internist in the city. He had been a friend of my father’s. He had a reputation for being a bit old-fashioned, but he was a good doctor. I was waiting for his report on my blood test, which he had taken a few days ago. He had also given me a thorough physical examination. I was a bit worried, since my father had died of a heart attack at age 60. I was 55. I had been feeling a bit tired lately, and had been having some dizzy spells. I was worried about what he might tell me. I had been waiting for about 10 minutes when the door opened and a woman came in. She was in her early 30s, with short blond hair. She was wearing a blue suit and white blouse. She was carrying a clipboard. “Hi,” she said. “I’m Dr. Crawford’s new assistant, Dr. Joan Miller. I’ll be taking over some of his duties while he’s away.” “Away?” I said. “Yes,” she said. “He’s been called out of town on an emergency. He asked me to give you the results of your blood test and physical exam.” “But I thought I was supposed to see him,” I said. “He’s not available,” she said. “I’m sorry, but that’s the way it is. He asked me to give you the results of your tests.” “All right,” I said. “What did the tests show?” “Your blood pressure is a bit high,” she said. “And your cholesterol level is a bit high, too. But other than that, you’re in good shape.” “That’s it?” I said. “That’s all he told you to tell me?” “That’s it,” she said. “Is there anything else you want to know?” “No,” I said. “That’s all I need to know.” “All right,” she said. “I’ll see you next time.” She turned and left the office. I was a bit puzzled. I had expected a more detailed report from Dr. Crawford. But I guess he was too busy to see me. I decided to call him the next day and get the details of my test results. But when I called his office the next day, I was told that he was still out of town. I decided to wait a few days and call him again.

Rusty is the thief.
When Rusty, Ann and I were looking for Cupcake, Rusty was the only one who didn't look outside. He was the only one who was still in the store when Uncle Ezra went down to the basement. So he could've snuck up to the counter and stolen the book. And he could've returned it later, when he came back to the store with Alfred.
But why did Rusty steal the book?
Because Rusty was jealous of Uncle Ezra's favorite book. He'd always wanted to be the one who knew the most about the Harry Potter series. And he'd always been secretly jealous of Uncle Ezra's autographed first edition.
But why did Rusty return the book?
Because Rusty knew that Uncle Ezra had hidden the real book in a cabinet under the counter. He was afraid that if he stole the real book, Uncle Ezra would notice that it was missing. So Rusty stole the decoy book instead.
But why did Rusty return the book? (continued)
Because he'd felt guilty. He'd never intended to keep the book. He just wanted to prove that he could steal it. And he wanted to prove that he knew more about Harry Potter than Uncle Ezra did. That's why he left the note -- so Uncle Ezra would know that he was the one who'd stolen the book.
But why did Rusty return the book? (continued again)
Because he wanted to prove that he was smarter than Uncle Ezra. He wanted to show that he could steal the book, and then return it, without Uncle Ezra ever knowing what had happened.

There was a man who was born in 1955. Today is his birthday and he is 32 years old. How is this possible?
He was born in room 1955 of a hospital.
The man was born in room number 1955 of a hospital.
A man is found murdered in his office. The detectives who responded to the scene found a calendar with the numbers 6, 4, 5, 3 and 9 circled. On the desk, there are two notes that say, "I am the murderer" and "He is the murderer." Who murdered the man?
The numbers on the calendar represent the months of the year. Six is June, four is April, five is May, three is March and nine is September. The detectives found the calendar in September, so the months leading up to September are June, April, May, and March. The notes read, "Jim is the murderer" and "Harry is the murderer." Jim (June, April, and May) is the murderer.
I am a 5 letter word. Take away the first letter, and I become an energy form. Take away the first two letters, and I am needed for living. Take away the first three letters and I am a drink. Take away the first four and I am used to eat. What word am I?
What number comes next in the sequence 1, 4, 27, 16, 125, 144, 441, 496, 3375?
The sequence is formed by adding the digits of the previous number, and if the result has more than one digit, adding the digits of the result.
A man was found murdered on Sunday morning. His wife called the police, and they questioned everyone that was there and they got these alibis: Wife: I was sleeping. Butler: I was taking the dog for a walk. Chef: I was starting breakfast. Chauffeur: I was in the garage. Who did it?
The chef.
The wife said she was sleeping, but her husband was found in the morning, meaning he died during the night. Therefore, she must have been awake when he was murdered. The butler said he was taking the dog for a walk, but he was found in the house, meaning the butler must have been in the house. The chauffeur said he was in the garage, but the door to the garage was locked and only the chauffeur had the key. The chef said he was starting breakfast, but the cook was still cold when the police arrived. Therefore, the chef was the only one with a reasonable alibi.

This is a mystery story. Your role is to find who is the culprit.
“You'll like it here,” said Debra. “Everything is a mystery.” Before I could digest the mystique of the mansion in front of me, or the height of its white columns, a gloomy butler swung open the door: “I heard your voices,” he barked. I gasped and swallowed my breath. Debra tried to mask her amusement and smiled at me, reassuringly: “You're just not used to rich people,” she said, pushing me forward. The butler, and the scowl on his face, led us down a long hallway where large statues of famous poets lined the walls: “Are they watching us?” I joked. Debra ignored my nervous sarcasm, thanked the butler cheerfully, and signaled me to follow her to the den. “My father's friends meet here every month,” she whispered. “And they play a very strange game.” Echoes from our own footsteps had me on edge as we made our way to a super-sized wooden door. Debra tapped on it playfully, and I held my breath. The hinges wept and moaned as the enormous door chiseled open, revealing a strange man who was noticeably short and very old. His bald head was almost shiny, and he donned an expensive, grey suit with an ugly tie. It had three different colors: purple, orange, and green. “You look awful!” he said to Debra.” She laughed and gave him a hug. “Is this your father?” I asked. “No!” he said quickly. And Debra laughed again. She had promised to introduce her father to the man who solved mysteries, and I'd been nervously anticipating the meeting all night. “I wonder how long it will take him to figure it out,” Debra giggled. I saw a long banner hanging on the wall. It had large red letters, celebrating the group who was arriving tonight: “The Liar's Club.” The realization kicked in: everything they'd said was a lie; that was the whole catch. I was ready to beat them at their own game. “You do look awful, Debra,” I said. “And your father is a real jerk!” They cheered and laughed, as we walked inside the room. Below the banner was a long table filled with sandwiches and desserts. The man and woman at the opposite side of the room acknowledged our presence with a head nod before returning to their conversation. One of them weighed over 300 pounds. “I hate these sandwiches,” the large man said, smiling. He took a big bite: “Especially the ones with mustard.” He wiped some mustard off his cheek, and then joyfully took another bite. The butler shuffled in, moving so carefully that his patent leather shoes never left the ground. He was carrying a large glass bowl, which was almost filled to the top with punch. I eyed it like a liquid treasure and licked my lips. My mouth was dry from all the gasps and gulps this place was bringing out of me. He was beginning to look like a circus juggler, making this a more difficult task than it should have been ― but my thirst controlled my thoughts. Maybe his gloves gave him less of a grip. He made it to the table, victorious, and released the bowl without spilling a drop. I moved quickly and poured myself a glass. Luke, who was still stuffing his face, watched me take down the whole cup in one gulp before he directed his attention back to the woman next to him. “You don't need to lose any weight,” she said solemnly. “You're the healthiest man I've ever seen!” Luke's eyes seemed to laugh, and he continued chewing vigorously. His fingers were hardly visible under the mustard that covered his hands. He flexed and I watch a glob just miss the woman. Flexing, he declared, “And the strongest!” The woman’s name was Olivia, and she was wearing an expensive diamond bracelet that rattled when she moved her hands. Olivia's dress was expensive; it bared her shoulders, and looked very comfortable. “I never have any fun when I come here,” she said to Debra. “Never any fun at all!” Both of them laughed as though they'd been friends for years. “Your father's tie is gorgeous,” she said. And they both laughed again. The mood changed quickly when Olivia pointed ominously to a marble pedestal at the center of the room. It displayed a glass box filled with dice. There were seven dice in the box, and each one was positioned to have rolled a six. “ There's not a story about those dice,” she confided to Debra. “And it's not the reason we gather here every month.” Debra had never heard the story, so we huddled around the display case, gawking at it in dazed silence ― and then the room went black. It seemed like a temporary power outage, and I waited for the lights to turn back on . The room became denser...colder. I fumbled for Debra’s hand, interlocking my fingers with hers. The whole mansion was listening to our silence. The walls seemed more alive than the people ― until someone broke the tension: “I can see perfectly,” Olivia joked. “Me too,” said Luke. It sounded like he was still eating. When the lights came back on, we saw a startling sight: the display case was empty ― and all the dice were gone! We stared in disbelief, and Debra's father looked horrified. Though the dice were worth very little, they had been in his family for more than one hundred years. They had a special significance to her father, and they were the emblem and livelihood of The Liar's Club. Sadly, he told the sentimental story behind the dice one last time, as his butler rearranged the sandwiches. His uncle had been a young man who needed to earn some money. But instead, he'd met a gambler who had challenged him to roll seven sixes. We listened on, intently. His uncle knew it was nearly impossible to roll seven dice and have a six come up on every single one, but he'd shaken the dice and tossed them onto the ground. And for every single one, believe it or not, he rolled a six. “The dice weren't rigged,” her father said with a grin. “He didn't weight down one side so they'd always roll a six.” He laughed uncontrollably. “His uncle had bought the dice, and they'd always made him feel hopeful, or lucky, during difficult times.” He released a long sigh, which was followed by a startled look: “Wait a minute,” he said, looking at me. “You don't solve mysteries, do you?” I pondered whether I should answer yes or no, and he angrily shouted at his guests: “Who stole my uncle's dice?” “I did!” said Olivia. “I did!” said Luke. “I did!” said Debra. And now her father was even more agitated. I held up a hand, signaling that I'd solve the crime. But looking around the room, I couldn't find a single clue. There weren't any obvious footprints on the floor, and the glass case was completely spotless. There were no suspicious fingerprints on the light switch by the door, and nothing had changed after the lights came back on. There was the table, still filled with food, and the "Liar's Club" banner still draped the wall. “Did the butler do it?” Olivia said playfully. She'd read several mystery books where the man behind the crime turned out to be a sneaky butler. “Your dice weren't so lucky tonight,” Luke joked. “Er, I mean they were lucky tonight. I mean ―.” “Cut it out,” Debra's father said impatiently. “I'm tired of playing games, and I want my dice back!” Sarcasm turned to shock in the room. They'd never heard him make a statement that wasn't a lie. Debra's father had broken the rules. I was feeling impatient, too. “Listen up, Liar's Club," I said, carefully choosing my words so they'd understand. “I don't know who stole your dice. And I'm not going to identify the thief now...” Who is the thief?

The culprit is Janice. She is the only one who could have taken the communion set. She could have done it before she went to sleep, as she was the last one to bed. She was the only one who would have known that Allison would be up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. The bruise on Allison’s toe is not important. Janice could have kicked the pew with her foot, as she was leaving the sanctuary. She would have been able to find her way in the dark by feeling her way along the wall.

Nick stole the ring.
The only person who could have stolen the ring was Nick. Billy was in the house the entire time. Austin and Nick were both outside, but Austin was helping make lunch. Since Billy was helping him, he was in the house as well. That leaves Nick. He was outside, but was over by the barn working on the tractor. Joe said that he was walking through the corn maze. The barn is on the opposite side of the house from the corn maze, so Nick couldn't have been in the maze. But he was the only one outside, so he must have been the one to steal the ring.

Jeffery Sharp, the computer tech.
It was Jeffery who had stolen the chip. He was the only one who could have shut down the computer system without leaving a record. The system’s time was off because Jeffery had changed it to match his time in Aruba. He had also changed the date so that the system would not record his entry and exit. He had done this before, so he knew the system well enough to disable the security system and still get out of the building without leaving a record.

Murder in the Jensen Family
A murder mystery story.
I would like to share this story with you. It is a murder mystery story. Your role is to find who is the culprit.
Todd Jensen recently inherited the old Jensen family home. He and his wife, Anne, were busy with repairs and remodeling. It was a wonderful inheritance, as the home, built in 1910, was surprisingly modern in design. So, it was on a bitterly cold and dark winter day that Todd sat across from his beloved cousin, Charlene, who had come for a visit. Todd took his seat after pouring steaming mugs of hot chocolate. He began to relate the story he had promised her. He did not tell her there would be a challenge as well …
Todd took his first sip of hot chocolate and said, “Thanks for coming. There are some things you need to know.” Todd and Charlene were more than cousins. They had been best friends and confidants for over 30 years – since they were both toddlers in diapers. Charlene replied, “No problem, Todd. What’s on your mind?” Todd took a deep breath. “Well, Anne and I found an old letter. It was pasted on the wall behind the wallpaper in the formal dining room. It was signed my Mildrid Jensen and dated May 25, 1925. She claims her husband Earl was murdered by their son, Edward Jensen.
Charlene exclaimed, almost choking on a sip of hot chocolate, “That’s our great-uncle!” “Yeah, I know, replied Todd, dryly, “and she said Edward was murdered in one of the upstairs rooms. Thoughtfully, Charlene answered, “There are four bedrooms, plus a bath upstairs. Which room was it?” Pausing for a moment, she asked, “Are you going to tell the police? What about the rest of the family?” Slowly, Todd answered, “This happened almost 84 years ago. Everyone in that generation is long passed. I believe it would be best to let sleeping dogs lie.”
Charlene understood perfectly. She nodded her head and asked, “Why tell me?” “You know that I share everything with you. Besides,” he grinned, “I have a challenge for you.” “What would that be? asked his cousin. “I will tell you the rest of the story, and you tell me what room great-grandfather was murdered in.” He and Charlene played mystery games as children, and now they had an opportunity to analyze a real Jensen family murder mystery. Charlene nodded and told him to continue.
Todd began relating his tale. “According to great-grandmother’s letter, Edward killed Earl in a fit of rage. It was about 10:00 p.m. on a spring evening. He was found slumped over in a chair with a knife mark in his neck.” “Why did he kill his own father?” “Mildrid indicated that Edward was what they called in those days, a ‘no-account.’ He was a cocksure 20-year-old who spent too much money and had a violent temper. The letter also says he had gotten a young woman pregnant out of wedlock. That was a serious taboo back then – so serious that it could, and often did, ruin an entire family’s reputation. Anyway, Earl and Edward argued about it. The disagreement was so severe that Earl lost his life because of it.” “May I see the letter?” “After you solve the mystery,” Todd grinned. Both sipped hot chocolate, which was now cool enough to drink. Charlene returned her cousin’s smile and said, “OK. Great-grandfather was murdered. It was covered up and nobody except Mildrid knew of it until you and Anne found the letter while remodeling the dining room?” “As far as we know, that is correct.” “Was he murdered in the same room where he was found?” “Yes.” “All right, what about the other family members? “Mildrid wrote that Anita was terrified and locked herself into her room when the argument began.” “Where was Mildrid?” Todd was pleased that his cousin was warming to her task. “She was downstairs and very frightened, but close to the stairs.” Charlene said, “Tell me about the upstairs bath.” “One of the nicest of its day,” said Todd. “As you know, it was large and even contained a small chair and reading table. It had state of the art plumbing and was one of the first to have a showerhead. The mint colored tile and enamel was very rare then as well.” “Harry … Edward … where were they?” “Harry was not in the house that night. He was estranged from the family in the 1920s. I know this because Dad and Mom used to speak of it. One night, he had a moving truck come and take everything from his room. Harry’s room was empty for a number of years. As far as Edward goes, he was home that night. Mildred did not say where he was when the murder took place.”
Todd refilled both cups with fresh chocolate. Charlene considered what she had heard for several minutes while Todd awaited her next question. Finally, she said, “A violent stabbing would have generated a lot of blood. Did any of the upstairs rooms have carpeting?” “Yes,” answered Todd. Edward and Anita’s rooms had carpet. In fact, new carpet had been installed in those rooms shortly before the killing. Mildred and Earl, as Ann and I are now, were doing some remodeling. The house was 15 years old in 1925 and was due for a bit of a facelift. Remember when we were kids? As late as 1983, the original carpets were still in both Edward and Anita’s rooms. They were over 55 years old.” “What about the master bedroom?” “The master bedroom was, for a prominent family such as ours was back then, fairly Spartan. Within the master bedroom there were twin beds, an armoire, a chest of drawers and a small vanity and stool for great-grandmother. No carpeting and, if I recall, they never even had throw rugs to keep their feet warm in the wintertime.” Charlene and Todd sat silent for what seemed a long time. Both finished a second cup of hot chocolate. Finally, Todd asked, “In which room was great-grandfather murdered.”
In which room was great-grandfather murdered?

So, it was on a bitterly cold and dark winter day that Todd sat across from his beloved cousin, Charlene, who had come for a visit. Todd took his seat after pouring steaming mugs of hot chocolate. He began to relate the story he had promised her. He did not tell her there would be a challenge as well … Todd took his first sip of hot chocolate and said, “Thanks for coming. There are some things you need to know.” Todd and Charlene were more than cousins. They had been best friends and confidants for over 30 years – since they were both toddlers in diapers. Charlene replied, “No problem, Todd. What’s on your mind?” Todd took a deep breath. “Well, Anne and I found an old letter. It was pasted on the wall behind the wallpaper in the formal dining room. It was signed my Mildrid Jensen and dated May 25, 1925. She claims her husband Earl was murdered by their son, Edward Jensen. Charlene exclaimed, almost choking on a sip of hot chocolate, “That’s our great-uncle!” “Yeah, I know, replied Todd, dryly, “and she said Edward was murdered in one of the upstairs rooms.

It was signed my Mildrid Jensen and dated May 25, 1925. She claims her husband Earl was murdered by their son, Edward Jensen.\nCharlene exclaimed, almost choking on a sip of hot chocolate, “That’s our great-uncle!” “Yeah, I know, replied Todd, dryly, “and she said Edward was murdered in one of the upstairs rooms. Thoughtfully, Charlene answered, “There are four bedrooms, plus a bath upstairs. Which room was it?” Pausing for a moment, she asked, “Are you going to tell the police? What about the rest of the family?” Slowly, Todd answered, “This happened almost 84 years ago. Everyone in that generation is long passed. I believe it would be best to let sleeping dogs lie.”\nCharlene understood perfectly. She nodded her head and asked, “Why tell me?” “You know that I share everything with you. Besides,” he grinned, “I have a challenge for you.” “What would that be? asked his cousin. “I will tell you the rest of the story, and you tell me what room great-grandfather was murdered in.” He and Charlene played mystery games as children, and now they had an opportunity to analyze a real Jensen family murder mystery. Charlene nodded and told him to continue.\nTodd began relating his tale. “According to great-grandmother’s letter, Edward killed Earl in a fit of rage. It was about 10:00 p.m. on a spring evening. He was found slumped over in a chair with a knife mark in his neck.” “Why did he kill his own father?” “Mildrid indicated that Edward was what they called in those days, a ‘no-account.’ He was a cocksure 20-year-old who spent too much money and had a violent temper. The letter also says he had gotten a young woman pregnant out of wedlock. That was a serious taboo back then – so serious that it could, and often did, ruin an entire family’s reputation. Anyway, Earl and Edward argued about it. The disagreement was so severe that Earl lost his life because of it.” “May I see the letter?” “After you solve the mystery,” Todd grinned. Both sipped hot chocolate, which was now cool enough to drink. Charlene returned her cousin’s smile and said, “OK. Great-grandfather was murdered. It was covered up and nobody except Mildrid knew of it until you and Anne found the letter while remodeling the dining room?” “As far as we know, that is correct.” “Was he murdered in the same room where he was found?” “Yes.” “All right, what about the other family members? “Mildrid wrote that Anita was terrified and locked herself into her room when the argument began.” “Where was Mildrid?” Todd was pleased that his cousin was warming to her task. “She was downstairs and very frightened, but close to the stairs.” Charlene said, “Tell me about the upstairs bath.” “One of the nicest of its day,” said Todd. “As you know, it was large and even contained a small chair and reading table. It had state of the art plumbing and was one of the first to have a showerhead. The mint colored tile and enamel was very rare then as well.” “Harry … Edward … where were they?” “Harry was not in the house that night. He was estranged from the family in the 1920s. I know this because Dad and Mom used to speak of it. One night, he had a moving truck come and take everything from his room. Harry’s room was empty for a number of years. As far as Edward goes, he was home that night. Mildred did not say where he was when the murder took place.”\nTodd refilled both cups with fresh chocolate. Charlene considered what she had heard for several minutes while Todd awaited her next question. Finally, she said, “A violent stabbing would have generated a lot of blood. Did any of the upstairs rooms have carpeting?” “Yes,” answered Todd. Edward and Anita’s rooms had carpet. In fact, new carpet had been installed in those rooms shortly before the killing. Mildred and Earl, as Ann and I are now, were doing some remodeling. The house was 15 years old in 1925 and was due for a bit of a facelift. Remember when we were kids? As late as 1983, the original carpets were still in both Edward and Anita’s rooms. They were over 55 years old.” “What about the master bedroom?” “The master bedroom was, for a prominent family such as ours was back then, fairly Spartan. Within the master bedroom there were twin beds, an armoire, a chest of drawers and a small vanity and stool for great-grandmother. No carpeting and, if I recall, they never even had throw rugs to keep their feet warm in the wintertime.” Charlene and Todd sat silent for what seemed a long time. Both finished a second cup of hot chocolate. Finally, Todd asked, “In which room was great-grandfather murdered.”\nIn which room was great-grandfather murdered?\nThe story is from my friend.

Answer: Kevin Morton.
Jensen was killed on the night of the first day. Fishback washed up on the second day. The other four people were all there the night of the first day. Jensen was killed that night, and the body was taken out to sea in the lifeboat, then washed up on shore the next day. Fishback, therefore, could not have been the murderer. That leaves the other four. Colson said that Jensen tried to hog the lifeboat for himself during the storm. But Jensen was already dead by then, so he couldn’t have tried to hog the lifeboat.
Colson was trying to cast suspicion on Jensen, who was already dead, in order to conceal the fact that he was the murderer.

## 5minutemystery-the-disappearing-dollhouse

The culprit is Lucius Oswald.
The first clue was the dollhouse's history. It was a gift from a powerful Russian lord to Princess Katarina. And in the present day, the dollhouse was also a gift from a powerful man. The second clue was the dollhouse's value. It was worth "at least ten million dollars," but Fiona hadn't had it appraised. The third clue was that the dollhouse was stolen after 8 a.m. and before 9 a.m. The fourth clue was that the thief was carrying something when they arrived. The fifth clue was that the thief's purse contained nothing. The sixth clue was that Julia's car contained nothing. The seventh clue was that the thief was in the house all morning.
The dollhouse was stolen between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. Julia arrived at 8 a.m., and Lucius arrived at 8:30 a.m. Kyle and Reg arrived after 9 a.m. So only Julia and Lucius were in the house all morning. Julia's purse contained nothing, and her car contained nothing. But Lucius was carrying something when he arrived: his clipboard. When we searched the kitchen, we found his clipboard lying on the counter. It was hollow, and the Russian dollhouse was inside!
Lucius was the culprit.
He was a powerful man, just like the Russian lord. And he was famous for being strange. He'd stolen the dollhouse before 9 a.m., and then hid it in his clipboard, which he carried into Fiona's house. Julia was carrying a clipboard, too, but she didn't steal the dollhouse. Lucius's clipboard was hollow, and the dollhouse was inside.
The suspects are Julia,Kyle,Lucius,Reg

## 5minutemystery-the-missing-son

Amanda knew the boys were tired. She felt sorry for her husband Warren this morning. He had left early to spend the day with his father, as last night his mother had passed away. The family had been notified of her heart attack just after dinner, and they spent the rest of the evening at the hospital. Amanda was grateful they all had the opportunity to say goodbye to her before she slipped into quiet sleep. They arrived home late. “No wonder the boys look fatigued”, she thought. “It’s been a trying time for us all.”
Amanda looked affectionately at her four boys as they hurriedly ate breakfast. Connor, at eighteen, was the oldest. He was what she called her feisty one. Until Coach Hastings at Upstate College had offered him a full athletic scholarship for next year, Connor had been lackadaisical in study habits and class attendance. Hastings was known as a no-nonsense coach who demanded the same effort in the classroom as he did on the football field. He also expected good citizenship from his players and those who could not stay out of trouble off the field needn’t worry about spending any time on it. Amanda had been pleased with the dramatic turnaround in her oldest son this year; Connor was doing everything he could to please both Coach Hastings and the faculty at Lee School.
Caleb, sixteen years old, was her studious son. He was just finishing his sophomore year at Lee School and had maintained a perfect 4.0 grade average since commencing middle school. Caleb hoped to be a research scientist someday and possessed the analytical and perfectionist attitude that persons in that field must have to succeed. Amanda often worried about his over-developed sense of perfection as there had been times Caleb had overworked himself to his own detriment. Caleb would literally do anything to succeed. Caleb looked worried this morning, but, didn’t he always? Amanda hoped that his first hour gym class would perk him up—Wednesday tended to be a pop quiz day.
Amanda considered Jordan, age fourteen. Jordan did not enjoy the robust health her other sons did. Jordan suffered from Hypoglycemia and it was no minor ailment with him, as he had been known to pass out at unexpected times. Amanda prayed that he would one day grow out of this. However, she took comfort in the fact that Jordan usually took pretty good care of himself. He watched carefully what he ate and drank, and monitored his exercise closely. Still, he could get dizzy and lightheaded at the oddest of times, especially when he overdid it. There had been several occasions in which the school nurse called, saying he arrived at school feeling weak and faint.
The youngest was Kyle. Kyle was twelve and in his first year at Lee. Kyle was her current “problem” child. He was experiencing attention span problems and not doing too well in school. However, while Kyle was currently getting poor grades, he wasn’t a troublemaker—he had a healthy desire to get along with his teachers and the vice principal. Amanda wryly wished he had the same desire to get along with his report card. Her husband, Warren, had been like that when Kyle’s age, so she hoped it would not be a long term problem.
Amanda continued to think of Kyle. Lee School was a place where an uninterested student could fail quickly. Pop quizzes, which were given frequently—usually either on Monday or Wednesday and often, both—carried as much weight as Friday tests and semester exams. This was of many reasons that Lee was the top school in the state, academically speaking.
Amanda considered it fortunate that Lee was both a middle and high school. It was even better that the school was scarcely half a mile down the block from their home. Unless the weather was severely wet or cold, the boys walked together the short distance to school. She liked the fact that the path was well traveled, as many neighborhood children walked to school past their house. It was also well patrolled, as there were crossing guards at two key intersections, plus a police squad car that sat in the parking lot of the Elizabeth Toland Branch Library in the mornings and afternoons, monitoring both the behavior of the children and the street traffic.
Amanda put all of her thoughts and cares behind her as she kissed each son goodbye. She watched them walk briskly down the sidewalk until out of sight. Stepping back into the house, she thought again, What a pretty day.
During the middle of the morning, the telephone rang. It was Marge Schroeder, the Lee School receptionist. Marge knew Amanda well from Connor’s time as a habitual occupant of the vice principal’s office. She said, “Good morning, Amanda. One of your sons did not make it to first hour. We don’t know where he is”
Amanda thought for a moment. Finally, she said to Marge, “I know who it was without you having to say. I’ll see you in a minute.” She told Marge who she suspected had skipped class and, before the startled Marge could answer, Amanda hung up and headed out the door.
Who skipped class?

However, while Kyle was currently getting poor grades, he wasn’t a troublemaker—he had a healthy desire to get along with his teachers and the vice principal. Amanda wryly wished he had the same desire to get along with his report card. Her husband, Warren, had been like that when Kyle’s age, so she hoped it would not be a long term problem.\nAmanda continued to think of Kyle. Lee School was a place where an uninterested student could fail quickly. Pop quizzes, which were given frequently—usually either on Monday or Wednesday and often, both—carried as much weight as Friday tests and semester exams. This was of many reasons that Lee was the top school in the state, academically speaking.\nAmanda considered it fortunate that Lee was both a middle and high school. It was even better that the school was scarcely half a mile down the block from their home. Unless the weather was severely wet or cold, the boys walked together the short distance to school. She liked the fact that the path was well traveled, as many neighborhood children walked to school past their house. It was also well patrolled, as there were crossing guards at two key intersections, plus a police squad car that sat in the parking lot of the Elizabeth Toland Branch Library in the mornings and afternoons, monitoring both the behavior of the children and the street traffic.\nAmanda put all of her thoughts and cares behind her as she kissed each son goodbye. She watched them walk briskly down the sidewalk until out of sight. Stepping back into the house, she thought again, What a pretty day.\nDuring the middle of the morning, the telephone rang. It was Marge Schroeder, the Lee School receptionist. Marge knew Amanda well from Connor’s time as a habitual occupant of the vice principal’s office. She said, “Good morning, Amanda. One of your sons did not make it to first hour. We don’t know where he is”\nAmanda thought for a moment. Finally, she said to Marge, “I know who it was without you having to say. I’ll see you in a minute.” She told Marge who she suspected had skipped class and, before the startled Marge could answer, Amanda hung up and headed out the door.\nWho skipped class?\nAmanda knew the boys were tired. She felt sorry for her husband Warren this morning. He had left early to spend the day with his father, as last night his mother had passed away. The family had been notified of her heart attack just after dinner, and they spent the rest of the evening at the hospital. Amanda was grateful they all had the opportunity to say goodbye to her before she slipped into quiet sleep. They arrived home late. “No wonder the boys look fatigued”, she thought. “It’s been a trying time for us all.” Amanda looked affectionately at her four boys as they hurriedly ate breakfast. Connor, at eighteen, was the oldest. He was what she called her feisty one. Until Coach Hastings at Upstate College had offered him a full athletic scholarship for next year, Connor had been lackadaisical in study habits and class attendance. Hastings was known as a no-nonsense coach who demanded the same effort in the classroom as he did on the football field. He also expected good citizenship from his players and those who could not stay out of trouble off the field needn’t worry about spending any time on it. Amanda had been pleased with the dramatic turnaround in her oldest son this year; Connor was doing everything he could to please both Coach Hastings and the faculty at Lee School. Caleb, sixteen years old, was her studious son. He was just finishing his sophomore year at Lee School and had maintained a perfect 4.0 grade average since commencing middle school. Caleb hoped to be a research scientist someday and possessed the analytical and perfectionist attitude that persons in that field must have to succeed. Amanda often worried about his over-developed sense of perfection as there had been times Caleb had overworked himself to his own detriment. Caleb would literally do anything to succeed. Caleb looked worried this morning, but, didn’t he always? Amanda hoped that his first hour gym class would perk him up—Wednesday tended to be a pop quiz day. Amanda considered Jordan, age fourteen. Jordan did not enjoy the robust health her other sons did. Jordan suffered from Hypoglycemia and it was no minor ailment with him, as he had been known to pass out at unexpected times. Amanda prayed that he would one day grow out of this. However, she took comfort in the fact that Jordan usually took pretty good care of himself. He watched carefully what he ate and drank, and monitored his exercise closely. Still, he could get dizzy and lightheaded at the oddest of times, especially when he overdid it. There had been several occasions in which the school nurse called, saying he arrived at school feeling weak and faint. The youngest was Kyle. Kyle was twelve and in his first year at Lee.

The culprit is Kyle.

In fact, it is Caleb.
## 5minutemystery-the-stolen-cupcake

In the story, Leslie had to leave the kitchen to take care of Ross. The culprit had to be one of the kids.
Caedon was the leader of the little group. He was good-natured, but he was often bossy with his peers, tending to want things his own way. Leslie was constantly reminding him to put others first; having Ross & Tony around certainly gave him the opportunity to practice! After a few moments spent deep in thought, she had the solution. “Everyone, come here and sit by me. We have something very important to talk about.” Leslie patted the couch beside her. After the children had gathered, she began by saying, “You all know that I have been baking this afternoon. I made some double chocolate cupcakes. But now, one is missing. Someone took it when I wasn’t looking. We all know that is against the rules. Does anyone know what happened?” Four sets of wide eyes looked back at her as they all shook their heads from side to side. So, there was one little actor in their midst! “Well, I know who did it.” She turned toward the culprit and said, “But what I want to know is where you have hidden the cupcake!” Who stole the cupcake?
Caedon is the culprit.
In the story, Leslie had to leave the kitchen to take care of Ross. The culprit had to be one of the kids. The first thing she noticed when she came back to the kitchen was that the chair was pulled back out again. She had pushed all the chairs in after they were done lunch, but this one looked like it had been pulled back out again, out then hastily (but not properly) pushed back in.
Leslie had to assume that the cupcake had been hidden, as none of these kids were particularly neat eaters at this stage in their lives (she ought to know!)

I think it was Tim. He was the only one who knew about the passcode and was the only one who would have been able to tamper with the evidence. The razor was used to create the hole in the door. It was not imbedded in the door. The razor was used to start the fire and was then thrown out to sea. Tim had access to the razor because he was the only one who knew about the passcode. He was also the only one who knew about the fire theory and he was the only one who could have tampered with the evidence.

# The Case of the Missing Necklace
Here is another mystery story. Your role is to find who is the culprit.
I was walking through the park one day when I heard a scream. I ran towards the sound and saw a woman crying. "What's wrong?" I asked. "Someone stole my necklace!" She sobbed. "It was a gift from my grandmother and I need to get it back." "Don't worry, ma'am. I'm sure I can find it for you," I assured her. I took a deep breath and looked around. There were four people in the park. I decided to interview each of them. I went up to the first person. He was a tall, lanky man. He had dark brown hair and wore a blue shirt. "Excuse me, sir," I asked. "Have you seen a woman's necklace?" "I'm sorry," he replied. "I haven't seen it." "Do you know who might have taken it?" I asked. "I'm afraid I don't," he sighed. "I'm sorry I can't be of more help." I thanked him and walked away. The next person I approached was a woman. She had curly blond hair and wore a white shirt. "Excuse me, ma'am," I asked. "Have you seen a woman's necklace?" "I'm sorry," she replied. "I haven't seen it." "Do you know who might have taken it?" I asked. "I'm afraid I don't," she sighed. "I'm sorry I can't be of more help." I thanked her and walked away. The next person I approached was a man. He had short black hair and wore a green shirt. "Excuse me, sir," I asked. "Have you seen a woman's necklace?" "I'm sorry," he replied. "I haven't seen it." "Do you know who might have taken it?" I asked. "I'm afraid I don't," he sighed. "I'm sorry I can't be of more help." I thanked him and walked away. The last person I approached was a woman. She had short red hair and wore a yellow shirt. "Excuse me, ma'am," I asked. "Have you seen a woman's necklace?" "I'm sorry," she replied. "I haven't seen it." "Do you know who might have taken it?" I asked. "I'm afraid I don't," she sighed. "I'm sorry I can't be of more help." I thanked her and walked away. I was about to give up when I saw a glint of silver in the grass. I bent down and picked up the necklace. I walked back to the woman and handed it to her. "Thank you so much!" She exclaimed. "You're a hero!" I smiled and walked away. I was proud of myself for solving the mystery of the missing necklace.
