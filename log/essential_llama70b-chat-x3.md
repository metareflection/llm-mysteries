[/INST]


Correct answer: B
The question asks whether Cole is over 6 feet tall.

Statement 1: Cole is under 7 feet tall.

* Sufficient: No, because it doesn't directly answer the question. Cole could still be 6 feet tall, which is over 6 feet, but still under 7 feet.
* Insufficient: Yes, because it doesn't provide enough information to conclude whether Cole is over 6 feet tall.

Statement 2: Every player on Cole's varsity basketball team is above 6'1".

* Sufficient: Yes, because it implies that Cole is also above 6'1", since they are on the same team. Therefore, Cole is over 6 feet tall.
* Sufficient: No, because there's no guarantee that Cole is actually on the team.

Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient, so the correct option is (C).

The logic for option (C) is as follows:

* If statement 1 is true, then Cole is under 7 feet tall, which means they are not over 6 feet tall.
* If statement 2 is true, then every player on Cole's team is above 6'1", which means Cole is also above 6'1" and therefore over 6 feet tall.

Therefore, either statement 1 or statement 2 provides enough information to answer the question, so option (C) is correct.

<s>[INST]Does Alice like elephants more than zebras? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Elephants are Alice's favourite animals. 
2. Zebras are the animals that Alice likes the least.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
Option (D) is the correct answer.

Statement 1 alone is not sufficient to determine whether Alice likes elephants more than zebras, as it only tells us that elephants are Alice's favorite animals, but does not provide any information about her preference for zebras.

Statement 2 alone is not sufficient to determine whether Alice likes elephants more than zebras, as it only tells us that zebras are the animals that Alice likes the least, but does not provide any information about her preference for elephants.

However, taking both statements together, we can conclude that Alice likes elephants more than zebras. This is because if elephants are Alice's favorite animals and zebras are the animals she likes the least, then it follows that she must prefer elephants to zebras.

Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer, as statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to answer the question.
Given answer: D


<s>[INST]All the students in a classroom wrote an exam. How many students are in the classroom? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Five students failed. 
2. One student was 29th from the top and 16th from the bottom.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
The question is asking for the number of students in a classroom who wrote an exam.

Statement 1: "Five students failed."

This statement alone is not sufficient to determine the number of students in the classroom. We don't know the total number of students who took the exam, so we can't determine the percentage of students who failed. Therefore, this statement is insufficient.

Statement 2: "One student was 29th from the top and 16th from the bottom."

This statement alone is sufficient to determine the number of students in the classroom. We know that the student was 29th from the top and 16th from the bottom, which means there were 29 students above them and 16 students below them. Therefore, the total number of students in the classroom is 29 + 16 = 45.

Therefore, the correct option is (B): Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Now let's consider why statement 1 is insufficient:

If we know that five students failed, we need to know the total number of students who took the exam to determine the number of students in the classroom. For example, if 50 students took the exam and five failed, then the number of students in the classroom is 50. But if 100 students took the exam and five failed, then the number of students in the classroom is 100. Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient to determine the number of students in the classroom.

Now let's consider why statement 2 is sufficient:

We know that the student was 29th from the top and 16th from the bottom. This means that there were 29 students above them and 16 students below them. Therefore, the total number of students in the classroom is 29 + 16 = 45. We can determine the number of students in the classroom without needing any additional information. Therefore, statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

In conclusion, option (B) is the correct answer. Statement 2 alone is sufficient to determine the number of students in the classroom, while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
The question asks which direction Samuel is facing.

Statement 1: Samuel is not facing North.

This statement alone is not sufficient to determine the direction Samuel is facing. If Samuel is not facing North, he could be facing any other direction, such as South, East, West, or any other direction. So, statement 1 is insufficient.

Statement 2: Samuel is facing the sun.

This statement alone is sufficient to determine the direction Samuel is facing. Since the sun rises in the East and sets in the West, if Samuel is facing the sun, he must be facing East or West. So, statement 2 is sufficient.

Now let's consider the options:

(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
This is incorrect because statement 1 alone is not sufficient to determine the direction Samuel is facing.

(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
This is correct. Statement 2 alone is sufficient to determine the direction Samuel is facing, while statement 1 alone is not sufficient.

(C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
This is incorrect because statement 1 alone is not sufficient, and statement 2 alone is sufficient.

(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
This is incorrect because statement 1 does not provide any additional information that would help determine the direction Samuel is facing, and statement 2 alone is sufficient.

(E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
This is incorrect because statement 2 alone is sufficient to determine the direction Samuel is facing.

Therefore, the correct option is (B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
The question asks whether there are only blue balls in the basket.

Statement 1: "There are no red balls in the basket."

* Sufficient: No, because it doesn't tell us anything about the presence of blue balls.
* Insufficient: Yes, because it rules out the possibility of red balls being present in the basket.

Statement 2: "The smallest ball in the basket is green."

* Sufficient: No, because it doesn't tell us anything about the presence of blue balls.
* Insufficient: Yes, because it rules out the possibility of the smallest ball being blue.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

* False. Statement 1 doesn't tell us anything about the presence of blue balls, so it's not sufficient.

(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

* False. Statement 2 doesn't tell us anything about the presence of blue balls, so it's not sufficient.

(C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

* True. If statement 1 is true, then there are no red balls in the basket, which means all the balls must be blue. If statement 2 is true, then the smallest ball is green, which means all the balls must be larger than the smallest ball, and therefore, all the balls must be blue.

(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

* False. Even if we combine statements 1 and 2, we still don't know whether there are only blue balls in the basket. There could be other colors present, like green and red.

(E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

* False. We've shown that statement 1 or statement 2 alone is sufficient, and statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are not sufficient.

Therefore, the correct option is (C): Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
Option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Statement 1: Leonid hates vegetables.

If Leonid hates vegetables, then it is likely that he does not like carrots, which are a type of vegetable. However, this statement does not necessarily mean that Leonid dislikes carrots specifically. Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2: Leonid prefers carrots to leeks.

If Leonid prefers carrots to leeks, then it is likely that he likes carrots more than leeks. However, this statement does not necessarily mean that Leonid likes carrots overall. Therefore, statement 2 alone is also insufficient to answer the question.

Option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Statement 2: Leonid prefers carrots to leeks.

If Leonid prefers carrots to leeks, then it is likely that he likes carrots more than leeks. This statement suggests that Leonid has a positive preference for carrots, which means that he might like carrots. Therefore, statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Statement 1: Leonid hates vegetables.

If Leonid hates vegetables, then it is possible that he also dislikes carrots, which are a type of vegetable. However, this statement does not provide conclusive evidence that Leonid dislikes carrots specifically. Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient to answer the question.

Option C: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Statement 1: Leonid hates vegetables.

If Leonid hates vegetables, then it is likely that he does not like carrots, which are a type of vegetable. Therefore, statement 1 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2: Leonid prefers carrots to leeks.

If Leonid prefers carrots to leeks, then it is likely that he likes carrots more than leeks. Therefore, statement 2 alone is also sufficient to answer the question.

Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Statement 1: Leonid hates vegetables.

If Leonid hates vegetables, then it is likely that he does not like carrots, which are a type of vegetable.

Statement 2: Leonid prefers carrots to leeks.

If Leonid prefers carrots to leeks, then it is likely that he likes carrots more than leeks.

Taken together, these statements suggest that Leonid does not like vegetables in general but has a positive preference for carrots specifically. Therefore, statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to answer the question.

Option E: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 and statement 2 taken together provide conclusive evidence that Leonid does not like vegetables in general but has a positive preference for carrots specifically. Therefore, option E is not the correct answer.

Conclusion:

Option D is the correct answer. Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to answer the question. They provide conclusive evidence that Leonid does not like vegetables in general but has a positive preference for carrots specifically. Therefore, it can be concluded that Leonid likes carrots.

2. Probability of either A or B or both A and B happening is 0.65.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
The question asks for the probability of event B occurring, which can be found using the following formula:

P(B) = P(A ∪ B) - P(A)

where P(A ∪ B) is the probability of either event A or event B occurring, and P(A) is the probability of event A occurring.

Now, let's evaluate each statement and determine whether it is sufficient to answer the question.

Statement 1: Probability of event A is 0.55.

This statement gives us the probability of event A, but it doesn't provide any information about the probability of event B. Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2: Probability of either A or B or both A and B happening is 0.65.

This statement gives us the probability of either event A or event B occurring, which is useful in finding the probability of event B. However, we still need to know the probability of event A to use the formula above. Therefore, statement 2 alone is also insufficient to answer the question.

Now, let's consider both statements together:

Combining statements 1 and 2, we have:

P(A) = 0.55
P(A ∪ B) = 0.65

Using the formula, we can now calculate the probability of event B:

P(B) = P(A ∪ B) - P(A)
= 0.65 - 0.55
= 0.10

Therefore, the probability of event B occurring is 0.10.

Based on the above analysis, the correct option is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

The logic for this option is that statement 1 provides the probability of event A, while statement 2 provides the probability of either event A or event B occurring. Combining these two statements allows us to calculate the probability of event B using the formula.

Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer.
Given answer: D

Correct answer: D
The question asks whether the building contractor needs a special license, and we are given two statements:

Statement 1: All buildings with more than 20 floors need a special license.
Statement 2: The building contractor wants to build a 30-story building.

Let's evaluate each option:

Option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Logic for: Statement 1 provides a general rule that all buildings with more than 20 floors require a special license. If the building contractor wants to build a 30-story building, which is more than 20 floors, then they would need a special license.

Logic against: Statement 2 does not provide any information about the licensing requirements for the building.

Conclusion: Option A is not the correct answer.

Option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Logic for: Statement 2 tells us that the building contractor wants to build a 30-story building. If the building contractor wants to build a 30-story building, they will need a special license, regardless of the general rule stated in statement 1.

Logic against: Statement 1 does not provide any information about the specific building the contractor wants to build.

Conclusion: Option B is not the correct answer.

Option C: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Logic for: Statement 1 provides a general rule that all buildings with more than 20 floors require a special license. If the building contractor wants to build a 30-story building, which is more than 20 floors, then they would need a special license, according to statement 1. Alternatively, statement 2 tells us that the building contractor wants to build a 30-story building, which implies that they need a special license, regardless of the general rule stated in statement 1.

Logic against: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 provides a definitive answer on its own.

Conclusion: Option C is the correct answer. Either statement 1 or statement 2 alone is sufficient to determine that the building contractor needs a special license.

Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Logic for: Statement 1 provides a general rule that all buildings with more than 20 floors require a special license. Statement 2 tells us that the building contractor wants to build a 30-story building, which is more than 20 floors. Together, these statements imply that the building contractor needs a special license.

Logic against: This option is similar to option C, but it requires both statements to be combined to reach the conclusion.

Conclusion: Option D is not the correct answer. Option C already covers the possibility that either statement 1 or statement 2 alone is sufficient.

Option E: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Logic for: None of the statements provides a clear answer.

Logic against: This option is the opposite of option C, which states that either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Conclusion: Option E is not the correct answer.

Conclusion:
The correct answer is option C: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient to determine that the building contractor needs a special license.

2. The brick-laying machines work twice as fast as the men.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
The question is asking for the time it would take 5 brick-laying machines to build a wall, given that 10 men can build the wall in 6 hours.

Let's analyze each statement:

Statement 1: "If 5 brick-laying machines work with 5 men, the wall will be built in 7.5 hours."

This statement provides us with a direct comparison between the time taken by men and brick-laying machines. We know that 10 men can build the wall in 6 hours, so if 5 machines and 5 men can build the wall in 7.5 hours, it means that the machines are slower than the men.

However, this statement doesn't tell us the exact time it would take for 5 brick-laying machines to build the wall on their own. Therefore, Statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Statement 2: "The brick-laying machines work twice as fast as the men."

This statement provides us with a comparison between the speed of the machines and the men. If the machines work twice as fast as the men, it means that they can build the wall in half the time taken by the men.

Therefore, if 10 men can build the wall in 6 hours, the machines can build it in 3 hours. So, Statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Now, let's consider both statements together:

If we combine both statements, we can deduce that the brick-laying machines work at a rate that is twice as fast as the men. From Statement 1, we know that 5 machines and 5 men can build the wall in 7.5 hours. Therefore, if we subtract the time taken by the men (6 hours), we can calculate the time taken by the machines:

7.5 hours - 6 hours = 1.5 hours

So, the brick-laying machines would take 1.5 hours to build the wall on their own.

Therefore, the correct option is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Correct answer: E
The question asks for the number of people in Ramya's restaurant, and we are given two statements:

1. The number of people in Abhinav's restaurant is at least 10 less than the number of people in Ramya's restaurant.
2. The sum of the number of people in Ramya's restaurant and Abhinav's restaurant is equal to 70.

Let's analyze each statement individually to determine which option is the correct one.

Statement 1:

* Sufficient: No, this statement alone is not sufficient to determine the number of people in Ramya's restaurant. We know that Abhinav's restaurant has at least 10 fewer people than Ramya's, but we don't know the exact number of people in either restaurant.
* Insufficient: Yes, this statement alone is insufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2:

* Sufficient: Yes, this statement alone is sufficient to determine the number of people in Ramya's restaurant. We know that the sum of the number of people in Ramya's and Abhinav's restaurants is 70, and we can calculate the number of people in Ramya's restaurant by subtracting the number of people in Abhinav's restaurant from 70.
* Insufficient: No, this statement alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Now, let's consider the options:

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone is not sufficient to determine the number of people in Ramya's restaurant.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 2 alone is sufficient to determine the number of people in Ramya's restaurant, but statement 1 alone is not sufficient.

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone is not sufficient, and statement 2 alone is sufficient.

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

This option is incorrect because we can calculate the number of people in Ramya's restaurant using statement 2 alone, without needing statement 1.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 2 alone is sufficient to determine the number of people in Ramya's restaurant.

Therefore, the correct option is (B): Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

[/INST]


Correct answer: A
The question is asking for the person who finished the task in the least amount of time.

Let's evaluate the statements:

1. Liam takes as much time as Salma and Pranav would take if they worked together.

This statement says that Liam's time is equal to the combined time of Salma and Pranav. It doesn't give any information about the individual times of Salma and Pranav. Therefore, this statement alone is not sufficient to answer the question.

2. Salma takes double the amount of time that Pranav and Liam take working together.

This statement gives a comparison between Salma's time and the combined time of Pranav and Liam. It doesn't give any information about the individual times of Pranav and Liam. Therefore, this statement alone is not sufficient to answer the question.

Now, let's consider both statements together:

From statement 1, we know that Liam's time is equal to the combined time of Salma and Pranav.
From statement 2, we know that Salma's time is double the combined time of Pranav and Liam.

We can deduce that Salma's time is double the time taken by Liam, and Pranav's time is half the time taken by Liam.

Now, we can calculate the time taken by each person:

Liam's time = x
Salma's time = 2x
Pranav's time = x/2

So, the person who finished the task in the least amount of time is Pranav, who took half the time taken by Liam.

Therefore, the correct option is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Logic for option (A):
Statement 1 alone is not sufficient because it doesn't give any information about the individual times of Salma and Pranav.

Logic for option (B):
Statement 2 alone is not sufficient because it doesn't give any information about the individual times of Pranav and Liam.

Logic for option (C):
Either statement 1 or statement 2 alone is not sufficient, because they don't give enough information to determine the person who finished the task in the least amount of time.

Logic for option (E):
Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient. This is incorrect because we have shown that statements 1 and 2 taken together are sufficient to answer the question.

Therefore, the correct option is (D).

Correct answer: B
The question asks for the number of boys in a family with 7 children.

Statement 1: "There are fewer girls than boys."

*Sufficient: This statement alone is sufficient to answer the question, as it directly provides information about the number of boys. If there are fewer girls than boys, then the number of boys is 7 - (number of girls).

Statement 2: "Each girl has half as many sisters as brothers."

*Insufficient: This statement alone is insufficient to answer the question, as it only provides information about the relationship between the number of girls and the number of boys, but not the actual number of boys.

Option (A) is the correct answer: Statement 1 alone is sufficient, while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Option (B) is incorrect: Statement 2 alone is not sufficient, as it doesn't provide the actual number of boys.

Option (C) is incorrect: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 alone is sufficient, but together they are sufficient.

Option (D) is incorrect: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are not sufficient, as they don't provide the actual number of boys.

Option (E) is incorrect: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient, but statement 1 alone is sufficient.

Therefore, the correct answer is option (A).

Correct answer: D
The question asks when Qi's birthday is, and we are given two statements:

Statement 1: Tony correctly states that Qi's birthday is after 2nd and before 5th March.
Statement 2: Brenna incorrectly states that Qi's birthday is on 3rd March.

Let's evaluate each statement and determine which option is the correct one.

Statement 1: Tony correctly states that Qi's birthday is after 2nd and before 5th March.

* Sufficient? No, this statement alone is not sufficient to determine Qi's birthday. It only gives us a range of possible dates (March 3rd to March 5th), but we need a specific date.

Statement 2: Brenna incorrectly states that Qi's birthday is on 3rd March.

* Sufficient? No, this statement alone is not sufficient to determine Qi's birthday. Brenna's statement is incorrect, so we cannot rely on it to determine the correct date.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

Option (A): Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

* Valid? No, statement 1 alone is not sufficient, as it only gives us a range of possible dates.

Option (B): Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

* Valid? No, statement 2 is incorrect, so it cannot be sufficient.

Option (C): Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

* Valid? No, statement 1 alone is not sufficient, and statement 2 is incorrect, so this option is not valid.

Option (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

* Valid? Yes, this option is valid. Although statement 2 is incorrect, it provides additional information that can be used together with statement 1 to narrow down the possible dates. With statement 1, we know Qi's birthday is between 3rd and 5th March. With statement 2, we know that Brenna incorrectly stated Qi's birthday as 3rd March. Therefore, we can conclude that Qi's birthday is not on 3rd March, and it must be either on 4th or 5th March.

Option (E): Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

* Valid? No, this option is not valid. We have already determined that option (D) is valid, so it is not possible that none of the statements are sufficient.

Therefore, the correct option is (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

[/INST]


Correct answer: B
The question asks whether Alexia is a doctor.

Statement 1: "Either Alexia or Jenny is a doctor."

* Logic for sufficiency: This statement alone does not provide enough information to determine whether Alexia is a doctor. It only tells us that either Alexia or Jenny is a doctor, but we don't know which one.
* Logic against sufficiency: If we know that Jenny is a nurse, then we can conclude that Alexia is not a doctor, as the statement implies that only one of them can be a doctor. However, we don't have that information.

Statement 2: "Alexia and Jenny are a doctor and nurse respectively."

* Logic for sufficiency: This statement provides enough information to answer the question. It tells us that Alexia is a doctor and Jenny is a nurse, so Alexia is indeed a doctor.
* Logic against sufficiency: None.

Therefore, (D) "Statements 1 and 2 taken together are sufficient" is the correct option.

Explanation:
We can conclude that Alexia is a doctor by combining the information from both statements. From statement 1, we know that either Alexia or Jenny is a doctor, and from statement 2, we know that Alexia is a doctor and Jenny is a nurse. Therefore, we can conclude that Alexia is a doctor.

The other options are incorrect because:

* (A) Statement 1 alone is not sufficient, as it doesn't provide enough information to determine whether Alexia is a doctor.
* (B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient, but it doesn't provide enough information to determine whether Alexia is a doctor.
* (C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is not sufficient, as we need both statements to conclude that Alexia is a doctor.
* (E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient, which is false, as we've shown that statements 1 and 2 taken together are sufficient.

Correct answer: E
The question asks whether there will be more crocodile attacks next year, and we need to determine which statement(s) are sufficient to answer this question.

Let's evaluate each option:

A. Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

ationale:

* Statement 1 indicates an increase in crocodile attacks over time, which could suggest a higher likelihood of more attacks in the future.
* Statement 2 provides a specific number of attacks, but it doesn' not give any information about the trend or likelihood of future attacks.

Against:

* Statement 1 alone doesn't give us enough information to determine the cause of the increased attacks, which could be a one-time event or a seasonal fluctuation.
* Without additional information, we can't infer a clear pattern or trend to predict future attacks.

B. Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

ationale:

* Statement 2 provides a specific number of attacks, which could indicate a baseline for the average number of attacks per year.
* If the number of attacks is consistently high, it could suggest a higher likelihood of more attacks in the future.

Against:

* Statement 2 alone doesn't give us information about the trend or pattern of the attacks.
* Without knowing the context or reasons behind the attacks, we can't infer whether the same conditions will persist in the future.

C. Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

ationale:

* Statement 1 provides information about the trend of increasing attacks, which could indicate a higher likelihood of more attacks in the future.
* Statement 2 provides a specific number of attacks, which could establish a baseline for the average number of attacks per year.

Against:

* Neither statement alone provides a complete picture of the situation.
* We need both statements to understand the context and make an informed prediction about future attacks.

D. Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

ationale:

* Combining both statements gives us a more comprehensive understanding of the situation.
* We can infer a growing trend in crocodile attacks and a consistent number of attacks per year, which could suggest a higher likelihood of more attacks in the future.

Against:

* We still don't know the root cause of the increased attacks.
* Other factors like environmental changes, human behavior, or animal behavior could impact the number of attacks.

E. Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

ationale:

* Both statements alone don't provide enough information to make a conclusive prediction about future attacks.
* We need more information about the context, such as environmental changes, human behavior, or animal behavior, to make an informed prediction.

The correct option is D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient. Although we don't have information on the root cause of the increased attacks, combining both statements gives us a better understanding of the situation, and we can infer a growing trend in crocodile attacks and a consistent number of attacks per year, suggesting a higher likelihood of more attacks in the future.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E

The question asks whether African member states formed the largest regional group in the United Nations in 1999.

Statement 1: The United Nations Secretary-General in 1999 was Kofi Annan, a Ghanaian.

Logic for sufficient: The fact that the Secretary-General was from Africa in 1999 may suggest that the continent had a strong presence in the UN. However, this statement does not directly address the question, and there is no direct correlation between the Secretary-General's nationality and the size of the African regional group.

Logic against sufficient: The Secretary-General's nationality does not determine the size of the regional group. Many other factors, such as population, economic power, and political influence, play a much greater role in determining the size of a regional group.

Statement 2: In 1998, the African regional group received the largest fraction of UN aid.

Logic for sufficient: This statement suggests that the African regional group was significant in size, as it received the largest fraction of UN aid. This could indicate that the group had a strong presence in the UN.

Logic against sufficient: However, receiving the largest fraction of UN aid does not necessarily mean that the African regional group was the largest. Other regions may have had a larger number of member states or a greater population, for example.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
This is incorrect, as statement 1 does not directly address the question and is not sufficient on its own.

Option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
This is incorrect, as statement 2 does not directly address the question and is not sufficient on its own.

Option C: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
This is incorrect, as neither statement 1 nor statement 2 is sufficient on its own.

Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
This is correct. Together, the two statements provide some evidence that the African regional group was significant in size. The fact that the Secretary-General was from Africa in 1999 suggests that the continent had a strong presence in the UN, and the fact that the African regional group received the largest fraction of UN aid in 1998 further supports this inference.

Option E: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
This is incorrect, as statements 1 and 2 taken together provide some evidence that the African regional group was significant in size.

Conclusion: The correct answer is option D, as statements 1 and 2 taken together provide some evidence that the African regional group was significant in size, although they do not conclusively prove that it was the largest.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
The question is asking us to determine the value of x.

Statement 1: x = 3

This statement alone is sufficient to answer the question, as it directly provides the value of x as 3. Therefore, option A is correct.

Statement 2: x = x

This statement alone is not sufficient to answer the question, as it only states that x is equal to itself, which doesn't provide any new information about the value of x. Therefore, option B is incorrect.

Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient:

If we have statement 1, we know that x = 3, which is sufficient to answer the question. If we have statement 2, we know that x = x, which is not sufficient to answer the question on its own. Therefore, option C is incorrect.

Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient:

If we have both statements, we know that x = 3 (from statement 1) and x = x (from statement 2). This doesn't provide any new information, as statement 2 doesn't provide any additional value for x. Therefore, option D is incorrect.

Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient:

This option is correct, as statement 1 alone is sufficient to answer the question, but statement 2 alone is not sufficient, and combining the two statements doesn't provide any new information. Therefore, option E is incorrect.

Conclusion:

Therefore, the correct option is A, as statement 1 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

[/INST]


Correct answer: D
The question asks whether our city has enough beds for patients, and we are given two statements:

1. A city needs at least 100 beds per thousand people.
2. Our city has 150 beds per thousand people.

We need to determine which statement(s) are sufficient to answer the question.

Let's evaluate each statement individually:

Statement 1: A city needs at least 100 beds per thousand people.

This statement provides a general guideline for the minimum number of beds required for a city. However, it doesn't give us any information about our specific city. Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2: Our city has 150 beds per thousand people.

This statement provides specific information about our city's bed-to-population ratio. It tells us that our city has 50 more beds per thousand people than the recommended minimum. This information is sufficient to conclude that our city has enough beds for patients. Therefore, statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Now, let's consider the options:

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone is insufficient, and statement 2 alone is sufficient.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

This option is correct. Statement 2 provides specific information about our city's bed-to-population ratio, which is sufficient to answer the question. Statement 1, on the other hand, provides a general guideline but lacks specific information about our city.

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone is insufficient, and statement 2 alone is sufficient. We need both statements to concluded that our city has enough beds for patients.

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone is insufficient, and statement 2 alone is sufficient. We don't need both statements to answer the question.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Therefore, the correct option is (B): Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
option (D) is the correct answer.

Here's why:

Statement 1 alone is not sufficient to determine whether Student X passed the test because it doesn't provide enough information about the total number of questions on the test. If the test had 10 questions, for example, then Student X would need to get at least 70% of 10, or 7 questions, correct to pass. But if the test had 20 questions, then Student X would need to get at least 70% of 20, or 14 questions, correct to pass.

Statement 2 alone is not sufficient to determine whether Student X passed the test because it doesn't provide any information about the number of questions on the test. Even if Student X got all the questions correct, if there were only 5 questions on the test, for example, thenStudent X would not have passed the test. 

Both statements taken together, however, provide enough information to determine whether Student X passed the test. If Student X got 7 questions correct out of 10, for example, then Student X would have scored 70% and passed the test. Similarly, if Student X got all 15 questions correct out of 20, then Student X would have scored 75% and passed the test. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer.

Here's a summary of the logic for each option:

Option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient.

* Sufficient: No, because it doesn't provide enough information about the total number of questions on the test.

Option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient.

* Sufficient: No, because it doesn't provide any information about the number of questions on the test.

Option C: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

* Sufficient: No, because statement 1 alone is not sufficient, and statement 2 alone is not sufficient.

Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

* Sufficient: Yes, because together they provide enough information to determine whether Student X passed the test.

Option E: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

* Sufficient: No, because we've already established that option D is sufficient.

Therefore, the correct answer is option D.

Correct answer: C

The question asks whether circle A is smaller than circle B.

Statement 1: The area of circle B is two times the area of circle A.

* Sufficient: If the area of circle B is two times the area of circle A, then circle A is smaller than circle B. Therefore, this statement alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2: The radius of circle B is less than the radius of circle A.

* Insufficient: If the radius of circle B is less than the radius of circle A, it does not necessarily mean that circle A is smaller than circle B. For example, circle B could have a larger radius than circle A, but still have a smaller area. Therefore, this statement alone is insufficient to answer the question.

Therefore, the correct option is (A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient, while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: F
Option (D) is the correct answer.

Statement 1 alone is insufficient because it only allows us to pour water out of the cup, but it doesn't provide any information about the amount of water in the cup.

Statement 2 alone is insufficient because it only allows us to measure the height of the water level in the cup, but it doesn't provide any information about the capacity of the cup.

However, if we combine both statements, we can determine the amount of water in the cup. We can use statement 1 to pour water out of the cup into a measuring cylinder or any other container, and then use statement 2 to measure the height of the water level in the cup. By comparing the height of the water level with the capacity of the cup, we can determine whether the cup is more than half full or at least half empty.

Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. Statement 1 alone is insufficient because it doesn't provide any information about the capacity of the cup.
2. Statement 2 alone is insufficient because it only provides information about the height of the water level in the cup, but not the capacity of the cup.
3. Combining both statements allows us to determine the amount of water in the cup by pouring water out of the cup and measuring the height of the water level.
4. By comparing the height of the water level with the capacity of the cup, we can determine whether the cup is more than half full or at least half empty.
5. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
The question is asking whether Bill can afford to buy more $50 pots for his garden. To determine this, we need to know how much money Bill has available in his budget and how much he has already spent.

Statement 1 alone is not sufficient because it only tells us that Bill has a budget of $300, but it doesn't give us any information about how much he has already spent.

Statement 2 alone is not sufficient because it only tells us that Bill has spent some of his budget on 7 plants that cost $40 each, but it doesn't give us any information about the total amount he has spent or how much he has left in his budget.

However, if we combine statement 1 and statement 2, we can calculate how much Bill has available in his budget to spend on more pots. We know that Bill has a budget of $300 and he has already spent some of it on 7 plants that cost $40 each, so he has spent a total of 7 x $40 = $280. This means he has $300 - $280 = $20 left in his budget.

Therefore, the correct option is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Logic for option (A):
* Statement 1 alone does not give us information about how much Bill has spent, so it is not sufficient to determine whether he can afford to buy more pots.
* Statement 2 alone does not give us information about Bill's total budget, so it is not sufficient to determine whether he can afford to buy more pots.

Logic for option (B):
* Statement 2 alone does not give us information about Bill's total budget, so it is not sufficient to determine whether he can afford to buy more pots.
* Statement 1 alone does not give us information about how much Bill has spent, so it is not sufficient to determine whether he can afford to buy more pots.

Logic for option (C):
* Statement 1 or statement 2 alone is not sufficient to determine whether Bill can afford to buy more pots, as we need both pieces of information to calculate how much he has available in his budget.

Logic for option (E):
* Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 alone is sufficient to determine whether Bill can afford to buy more pots, as we need both pieces of information to calculate how much he has available in his budget.

Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer.

Option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient, while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Statement 1: Justin's sister's father's son is Tim.

This statement reveals that Tim is the son of Justin's sister's father, making Tim Justin's nephew. Therefore, statement 1 alone is sufficient to establish the relationship between Tim and Justin.

Statement 2: Justin is Tim's brother's father-in-law's only daughter's brother-in-law.

This statement is a bit more complex, but it can be broken down as follows:

* Justin is the brother-in-law of Tim's father-in-law's only daughter.
* Therefore, Tim's father-in-law is also Justin's brother-in-law.
* Since Tim's father-in-law is married to Justin's sister, Justin's sister is Tim's mother-in-law.
* Therefore, Tim is Justin's nephew.

However, this statement does not provide a direct relationship between Tim and Justin, and it requires a few steps to establish the relationship. Therefore, statement 2 alone is insufficient to answer the question.

Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

When we combine both statements, we get a clearer picture of the relationship between Tim and Justin:

* Statement 1: Tim is Justin's nephew.
* Statement 2: Tim is also Justin's brother-in-law.

Taken together, these statements confirm that Tim is indeed Justin's nephew and brother-in-law. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.

Logic against option C:

Option C suggests that either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient to answer the question. However, we've seen that statement 2 alone is insufficient, as it requires additional information to establish the relationship between Tim and Justin. Therefore, option C is incorrect.

Logic against option E:

Option E suggests that neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together are sufficient to answer the question. However, we've seen that statement 1 alone is sufficient, and when combined with statement 2, they provide a clear answer. Therefore, option E is also incorrect.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the correct option is D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to answer the question. We've seen that statement 1 alone is sufficient to establish the relationship between Tim and Justin, and statement 2 provides additional information that confirms this relationship. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.

Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
Option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Logic for:

* Statement 1 implies that x is divisible by the factors of 10, which means x is a multiple of 10.
* A prime number cannot be a multiple of 10, as it must be divisible only by 1 and itself.
* Therefore, statement 1 alone is sufficient to conclude that x is not a prime number.

Logic against:

* Statement 1 does not provide any information about whether x is greater than 13.
* A number can be a multiple of 10 and still be a prime number, as long as it is greater than 13.

Option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Logic for:

* Statement 2 implies that x is greater than 13.
* A prime number must be greater than 13, as the first prime number is 13.
* Therefore, statement 2 alone is sufficient to conclude that x is a prime number.

Logic against:

* Statement 2 does not provide any information about whether x is divisible by the factors of 10.
* A number can be greater than 13 and still not be a prime number, as it could be a multiple of 10.

Option C: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Logic for:

* Statement 1 implies that x is a multiple of 10, which means it cannot be a prime number.
* Statement 2 implies that x is greater than 13, which is a necessary condition for a prime number.
* Either statement alone can provide sufficient information to determine whether x is a prime number or not.

Logic against:

* Neither statement provides complete information about x.
* A number can be a multiple of 10 and still be greater than 13, but it would not be a prime number.

Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Logic for:

* Statement 1 implies that x is a multiple of 10.
* Statement 2 implies that x is greater than 13.
* Together, they provide complete information about x, as it cannot be a prime number if it is a multiple of 10 and is greater than 13.

Logic against:

* The statements together do not provide information about the primality of x.
* A number can be a multiple of 10 and still be greater than 13, but it would not be a prime number.

Option E: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Logic for:

* Statement 1 alone is not sufficient, as it only provides information about x being a multiple of 10.
* Statement 2 alone is not sufficient, as it only provides information about x being greater than 13.
* Together, they also do not provide complete information, as a number can be a multiple of 10 and still be greater than 13, but it would not be a prime number.

Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

2. 10% of the people in Maria's office read the newspaper.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
The question asks for the number of people in Maria's office who read the newspaper.

Let's examine each statement and determine whether it is sufficient to answer the question.

Statement 1: Half the people in the office don't read the newspaper.

This statement tells us that 50% of the people in the office do not read the newspaper. However, it does not provide any information about the remaining 50%. Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2: 10% of the people in Maria's office read the newspaper.

This statement tells us that 10% of the people in the office read the newspaper. However, it does not provide any information about the remaining 90%. Therefore, statement 2 alone is insufficient to answer the question.

Now, let's consider both statements together:

Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together tell us that 50% of the people in the office do not read the newspaper and 10% of the people in the office read the newspaper. This means that 40% of the people in the office do not read the newspaper (50% - 10%).

Therefore, the number of people in Maria's office who read the newspaper is 10% of the total number of people in the office.

So, the correct option is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

In conclusion, neither statement 1 nor statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question, but when taken together, they provide sufficient information to determine the number of people in Maria's office who read the newspaper.

2. Rita is only taller than Kathy and Komal.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
Option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient, while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Statement 1: Komal is neither the tallest nor the shortest.

From this statement, we can infer that Komal is of average height among the five people. Since no two people are of the same height, Komal's height is unique. Therefore, we can determine the third tallest person by comparing Komal's height with the others.

Statement 2: Rita is only taller than Kathy and Komal.

From this statement, we can infer that Rita is taller than Kathy and Komal, but we cannot determine whether Rita is the tallest or not. Therefore, statement 2 alone is insufficient to determine the third tallest person.

Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

Option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient, while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 2 alone does not provide enough information to determine the third tallest person. We need to know the height of all five people to determine the third tallest person.

Option C: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone is sufficient, while statement 2 alone is not sufficient.

Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

This option is incorrect because we can determine the third tallest person using only statement 1. Statement 2 does not provide any new information that helps us determine the third tallest person.

Option E: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because we can determine the third tallest person using statement 1 alone.

Therefore, the correct answer is option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient, while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
One approach to solving this problem is to consider each statement and whether it provides sufficient information to determine whether x is divisible by 2.

Statement 1: x is an even number.
This statement is sufficient to determine that x is divisible by 2 because an even number is always divisible by 2. Therefore, if x is an even number, it is necessarily divisible by 2.

Statement 2: The square root of x is greater than 4.
This statement is not sufficient to determine whether x is divisible by 2. For example, the square root of 9 is greater than 4, but 9 is not divisible by 2. The square root of 16 is also greater than 4, but 16 is divisible by 2. Therefore, this statement does not provide sufficient information to determine whether x is divisible by 2.

Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 alone provides sufficient information to determine whether x is divisible by 2. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

When both statements are taken together, we know that x is an even number (statement 1), and the square root of x is greater than 4 (statement 2). This means that x must be a positive even number greater than 4, which means it must be divisible by 2. Therefore, taking both statements together provides sufficient information to determine that x is divisible by 2.

So, the correct answer is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.

[/INST]


Correct answer: C
The question asks for the age of Qi, and we are given two statements:

1. Five years ago, Qi's age was half of her current age.
2. Qi will be 23 years old in 5 years.

Let's analyze each statement and determine which option is the correct one.

Statement 1: Five years ago, Qi's age was half of her current age.

Logic for sufficiency:

* If Qi's current age is x, then her age five years ago was x/2.
* Since Qi's age five years ago was half of her current age, we can set up an equation: x/2 = x - 5.
* Solving for x, we get x = 10.

Logic against sufficiency:

* We know that Qi's age five years ago was half of her current age, but we don't know what her current age is.
* Without knowing Qi's current age, we cannot determine her age five years ago.

Statement 2: Qi will be 23 years old in 5 years.

Logic for sufficiency:

* If Qi will be 23 years old in 5 years, then her current age is 23 - 5 = 18.

Logic against sufficiency:

* We know that Qi will be 23 years old in 5 years, but we don't know what her current age is.
* Without knowing Qi's current age, we cannot determine her age five years ago.

Now, let's consider the options:

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone is not sufficient to determine Qi's age five years ago. We need statement 2 to determine Qi's current age.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 2 alone is not sufficient to determine Qi's age five years ago. We need statement 1 to determine Qi's age five years ago.

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

This option is correct. We can use either statement 1 or statement 2 to determine Qi's age five years ago.

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

This option is incorrect because we don't need both statements to determine Qi's age five years ago. We can use either statement 1 or statement 2 alone to determine her age.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because we can use either statement 1 or statement 2 alone to determine Qi's age five years ago.

Therefore, the correct option is (C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient to determine Qi's age five years ago.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
The question asks when Tony's birthday is, and we are given two statements that provide information about the birthday.

Statement 1: Natasha correctly states that Tony's birthday is after 16th and before 19th March.

This statement provides a range of dates within which Tony's birthday falls. It is not specific enough to determine the exact date of Tony's birthday. Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient to answer the question.

Logic against statement 1 being sufficient:

* The range of dates provided by statement 1 is too broad, and there are multiple dates within that range that could be Tony's birthday.

Statement 2: Brenna incorrectly states that Tony's birthday is on 20th March.

This statement provides a specific date for Tony's birthday, but it is incorrect. Therefore, statement 2 alone is not sufficient to answer the question.

Logic against statement 2 being sufficient:

* The statement is incorrect, so it does not provide reliable information about Tony's birthday.

Now, let's consider the options:

Option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone is not sufficient to determine Tony's birthday.

Option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 2 is incorrect and does not provide reliable information about Tony's birthday.

Option C: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because neither statement 1 nor statement 2 alone is sufficient to determine Tony's birthday.

Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

This option is correct. When we combine statement 1 and statement 2, we can determine that Tony's birthday is between 17th and 19th March, and it cannot be on 20th March. Therefore, the correct answer is option D.

Option E: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because we have shown that option D is correct.

Conclusion:

The correct option is D. Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to determine Tony's birthday.

[/INST]


Correct answer: A
The question asks for the number of cows on a farm where there are 50 cowsheds. The statements are:

Statement 1: Each cowshed contains one cow.
Statement 2: There are at least 60 cows.

Let's analyze each statement and determine whether it is sufficient to answer the question.

Sufficiency of Statement 1:

* If each cowshed contains one cow, then we know that there are 50 cows in total, since there are 50 cowsheds.
* Therefore, statement 1 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Sufficiency of Statement 2:

* If there are at least 60 cows, then we know that there are more cows than cowsheds (50).
* However, we don't know how many cows are in each cowshed, so we can't determine the exact number of cows.
* Therefore, statement 2 alone is insufficient to answer the question.

Sufficiency of Both Statements:

* If we combine both statements, we know that each cowshed contains one cow, and there are at least 60 cows.
* We can conclude that there are exactly 50 cows, since there are 50 cowsheds and each contains one cow.
* Therefore, both statements taken together are sufficient to answer the question.

Therefore, the correct option is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to answer the question.

Logic for option (A):

* Statement 1 alone is sufficient because it provides a direct answer to the question.
* Statement 2 alone is not sufficient because it doesn't provide a direct answer to the question.

Logic for option (B):

* Statement 2 alone is sufficient because it implies that there are more cows than cowsheds, which means there must be at least one cow per cowshed.
* Statement 1 alone is not sufficient because it doesn't provide an upper bound on the number of cows.

Logic for option (C):

* Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient because they both provide useful information.
* However, this option is incorrect because statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Logic for option (E):

* Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
* This option is incorrect because statements 1 and 2 taken together are sufficient.

Conclusion:

The correct option is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to answer the question. This is because statement 1 provides a direct answer to the question, and statement 2 provides an upper bound on the number of cows, which combined with statement 1, gives us the exact number of cows.

(F). The question can be answered without either statement.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: F
Option F is the correct answer.

Here's why:

1. Statement 1: "Saina Nehwal has more physical stamina than P. V. Sindhu"

This statement does not provide any information about the badminton skills or abilities of the two players. It only implies that Saina Nehwal may have an advantage in terms of endurance, but it does not necessarily mean that she will win the match. Therefore, this statement alone is not sufficient to answer the question.

2. Statement 2: "P. V. Sindhu is ranked higher as a badminton player than Saina Nehwal"

This statement provides information about the relative skill levels of the two players, with P. V. Sindhu being ranked higher. However, it does not guarantee that she will win the match, as Saina Nehwal may have other strengths or skills that could give her an advantage. Therefore, this statement alone is also not sufficient to answer the question.

Together, statements 1 and 2 provide a more complete picture of the match. While P. V. Sindhu's higher ranking suggests that she may have an advantage in terms of skill, Saina Nehwal's physical stamina could give her an edge in terms of endurance. Therefore, taking both statements together, it is still unclear who will win the match, and we cannot say for certain which of the two outcomes is more likely.

Therefore, the correct option is (F) "The question can be answered without either statement."

In conclusion, neither statement 1 nor statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question, but taking both statements together still does not provide a clear answer. Therefore, we must conclude that the question can be answered without either statement, and the correct option is (F).

[/INST]


Correct answer: B
The question asks whether some PQRs are also XYZs.

Statement 1: Some XYZs are ABCs.

This statement does not provide any information about PQRs, and therefore, it is not sufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2: Some XYZs are PQRs.

This statement indicates that some XYZs are also PQRs, which means that some PQRs are also XYZs. Therefore, this statement alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

This is incorrect because statement 1 does not provide any information about PQRs and is therefore not sufficient to answer the question.

(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

This is correct. Statement 2 alone provides sufficient information to answer the question, while statement 1 does not.

(C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

This is incorrect because statement 1 is not sufficient to answer the question, and statement 2 alone is sufficient.

(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

This is incorrect because statement 1 does not provide any relevant information, and statement 2 alone is sufficient.

(E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

This is incorrect because statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Therefore, the correct option is (B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Correct answer: C
Option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient. 

Logic for statement 1 being sufficient: If the author of "Under the Sun" only writes adventure books, then it is likely that Alina will want to read the book, as she is looking for an adventure book.

Logic against statement 2 being sufficient: Even if Alina is only offered adventure and mystery books, and "Under the Sun" is not a mystery book, it does not necessarily mean that she will want to read it. She may still prefer another adventure book over "Under the Sun".

Option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient. 

Logic for statement 2 being sufficient: If Alina is only offered adventure and mystery books, and "Under the Sun" is not a mystery book, then it is likely that she will want to read it, as it is the only available adventure book.

Logic against statement 1 being sufficient: If the author of "Under the Sun" only writes adventure books, it does not necessarily mean that Alina will want to read the book. She may have other preferences or interests that do not align with the author's genre.

Option C: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient. 

Logic for statement 1 being sufficient: See logic for option A.

Logic for statement 2 being sufficient: See logic for option B.

Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient. 

Logic: If the author of "Under the Sun" only writes adventure books, and Alina is only offered adventure and mystery books, then it is likely that she will want to read "Under the Sun", as it aligns with her preference for adventure books and is the only available option.

Option E: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient. 

Logic: If Alina's preferences do not align with the author's genre, or if there are other factors that influence her decision, such as the book's summary or reviews, then neither statement 1 nor statement 2 alone would be sufficient to determine whether she will want to read "Under the Sun". Additionally, even if both statements are combined, it still does not provide enough information to accurately determine Alina's preference.

Conclusion: The correct option is D. Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to determine whether Alina will want to read "Under the Sun". This is because the combination of the two statements provides information about the author's genre and Alina's preferences, which can help to infer her interest in the book.

Let's evaluate each option:

A. Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Logic for:

* Statement 1 tells us that Betty answered False, which means the correct answer is True.

Logic against:

* Statement 2 doesn't provide any information about the correct answer.

B. Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Logic for:

* Statement 2 tells us that the test has 5 questions, which means there are only two possible answers for each question: True or False.
* If Betty answered False, then the correct answer must be True.

Logic against:

* Statement 2 doesn't tell us which question Betty answered incorrectly.

C. Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Logic for:

* Statement 1 tells us that Betty answered False, which means the correct answer is True.
* Statement 2 tells us that the test has 5 questions, which means there are only two possible answers for each question: True or False.

Logic against:

* Neither statement provides any information about which question Betty answered incorrectly.

D. Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Logic for:

* Statement 1 tells us that Betty answered False, which means the correct answer is True.
* Statement 2 tells us that the test has 5 questions, which means there are only two possible answers for each question: True or False.
* By combining both statements, we can infer that Betty answered False to a question that has only two possible answers, which means the correct answer is True.

Logic against:

* None.

E. Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Logic for:

* None.

Logic against:

* Statements 1 and 2 provide some information about the test and the question Betty answered incorrectly.

Conclusion:

The correct option is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient. By combining both statements, we can infer that Betty answered False to a question that has only two possible answers, which means the correct answer is True. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.

2. The difference in the marks obtained by S and T is fifteen and the difference in the marks obtained by U and V is nine.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
The question asks for the difference in marks obtained by S and V.

Statement 1: The difference in marks obtained by T and U is eleven, and U got the highest marks.

From this statement, we can infer that U has the highest marks, and T has marks that are 11 less than U. However, this statement does not provide any information about S and V, so we cannot determine the difference in marks between S and V. Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Statement 2: The difference in marks obtained by S and T is fifteen, and the difference in marks obtained by U and V is nine.

From this statement, we can infer that the difference in marks between S and T is 15, and the difference in marks between U and V is 9. Since we know that U has the highest marks, we can deduce that the difference in marks between S and V is 15 + 9 = 24. Therefore, statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Now, let's consider the options:

(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone is not sufficient to answer the question, as mentioned above.

(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

This option is correct because statement 2 alone provides sufficient information to answer the question, while statement 1 does not.

(C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone is not sufficient, and statement 2 alone is sufficient.

(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 does not provide any information about S and V, and statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

(E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Therefore, the correct option is (B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

[/INST]


Correct answer: C
The question asks how R is related to Q, and we are given two statements:

1. R is the niece of P.
2. S has one sister R.

We need to determine which statement(s) are sufficient to answer the question.

 Statement 1: R is the niece of P.

* Sufficient: This statement alone is sufficient to answer the question. We know that R is the niece of P, which means that P is the uncle of R. Since Q is the brother of R, Q is also the nephew of P, and therefore, P is the uncle of Q.

 Statement 2: S has one sister R.

* Insufficient: This statement alone is insufficient to answer the question. We know that R is the sister of S, but we don't know how R is related to Q.

Now, let's consider both statements together:

* Sufficient: Together, both statements are sufficient to answer the question. We know that R is the niece of P and has one sister S. This means that P is the uncle of R and S is the sister of R. Therefore, P is the uncle of Q, and S is the sister of Q.

So, the correct option is (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Correct answer: E
The question asks for the total number of ants in the room, and we are given two statements:

Statement 1: Only black ants can be found indoors.
Statement 2: There are seven red ants in this room.

Now, let's evaluate each statement and determine which option is the correct one:

Option (A): Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Logic for:

* Statement 1 tells us that only black ants can be found indoors, which means that all the ants in the room are black.
* Statement 2 does not provide any information about the number of black ants in the room, so it is insufficient on its own.

Logic against:

* Statement 1 does not mention anything about the number of ants in the room, so it is not sufficient to answer the question.

Option (B): Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Logic for:

* Statement 2 tells us that there are seven red ants in the room, which means that there are at least seven ants in the room.
* Statement 1 does not provide any information about the number of ants in the room, so it is insufficient on its own.

Logic against:

* Statement 2 only tells us about the number of red ants in the room, but it does not tell us about the number of black ants or the total number of ants.

Option (C): Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Logic for:

* Statement 1 tells us that only black ants can be found indoors, which means that all the ants in the room are black.
* Statement 2 tells us that there are seven red ants in the room, which means that there are at least seven ants in the room.
* Either statement alone provides some information about the ants in the room, but neither statement provides the total number of ants.

Logic against:

* Neither statement provides the total number of ants in the room.

Option (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Logic for:

* Statement 1 tells us that only black ants can be found indoors, which means that all the ants in the room are black.
* Statement 2 tells us that there are seven red ants in this room, which means that there are at least seven ants in the room.
* By combining both statements, we can conclude that there are at least seven black ants in the room.

Logic against:

* We still don't know the exact number of ants in the room.

Option (E): Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Logic for:

* Statement 1 does not provide any information about the number of ants in the room.
* Statement 2 only tells us about the number of red ants in the room, but it does not tell us about the number of black ants or the total number of ants.
* Even by combining both statements, we still don't know the total number of ants in the room.

Logic against:

* This option is incorrect because we have shown that statement 1 and statement 2 taken together provide some information about the ants in the room.

After evaluating each option, we can see that the correct answer is option (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient. By combining both statements, we can conclude that there are at least seven black ants in the room, but we still don't know the exact number of ants in the room.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
Option (D) is the correct answer.

Let's analyze each statement and determine whether it is sufficient to answer the question:

1. Statement 1: "The hour hand is between 5 and 6."

This statement is insufficient to determine the time shown by the clock. The hour hand could be at 5:05, 5:15, 5:25, 5:35, 5:45, 5:55, or 5:60. There are too many possibilities, so we need more information.

2. Statement 2: "The clock shows a quarter past five."

This statement is sufficient to determine the time shown by the clock. Since it is a quarter past five, the hour hand must be at 5:15, 5:30, 5:45, or 5:60.

Now, let's consider the options:

(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone is not sufficient to determine the time shown by the clock.

(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 2 alone is sufficient to determine the time shown by the clock, but statement 1 provides additional information that can help to narrow down the possibilities.

(C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone is not sufficient, and statement 2 alone is sufficient.

(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

This option is correct because when we combine the two statements, we can determine the time shown by the clock. The hour hand is between 5 and 6, and it shows a quarter past five, which means the time is 5:15, 5:30, 5:45, or 5:60.

(E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because we have already determined that statement 2 alone is sufficient, and combining it with statement 1 provides even more information.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
One' everyone! Let's break down the question and analyze each statement to determine which option is correct.

Statement 1: Q is to the north of R, who is to the west of P.

This statement tells us that Q is located to the north of R, and R is located to the west of P. This means that Q is located to the north-west of P.

Statement 2: P is to the north-west of S.

This statement tells us that P is located to the north-west of S, but it doesn't provide any information about Q's location relative to P.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

Option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 doesn't provide enough information to determine P's direction from Q. We need statement 2 to know that P is located to the north-west of S, which helps us determine that Q is located to the north-west of P.

Option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 2 doesn't provide enough information to determine Q's location relative to P. We need statement 1 to know that Q is located to the north of R, who is located to the west of P.

Option C: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because we need both statements to determine P's direction from Q. Statement 1 provides information about Q's location relative to R, and statement 2 provides information about P's location relative to S, which helps us determine P's direction from Q.

Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

This option is correct! Together, both statements provide enough information to determine P's direction from Q. Statement 1 tells us that Q is located to the north of R, who is located to the west of P, and statement 2 tells us that P is located to the north-west of S. This information allows us to conclude that P is located towards the north-west of Q.

Option E: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because we've shown that option D is correct.

Therefore, the correct option is D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to determine P's direction from Q.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
Option (D) is the correct answer.

Statement 1 alone is not sufficient to determine the relationship between A and B, as we don't know how A is related to Nishant and Arav.

Statement 2 alone is not sufficient to determine the relationship between A and B, as we don't know who A's father is or how he is related to Arav's mother.

However, taking both statements together, we can conclude that A and B are related. Here's how:

From statement 1, we know that B has two brothers, Nishant and Arav.

From statement 2, we know that A's father is the brother of Arav's mother. This means that Arav's mother and A's father are siblings, which makes A and Arav first cousins.

Since A and Arav are first cousins, and Arav is a brother of B, we can conclude that A and B are related. Specifically, A and B are first cousins once removed.

Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer, as statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to determine the relationship between A and B.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
Option (D) is the correct answer.

Statement 1 alone is not sufficient to answer the question because it only mentions that buses usually depart on time, but it doesn't provide any specific information about the departure time of the bus to the airport.

Statement 2 alone is not sufficient to answer the question because it only mentions the scheduled arrival time at the airport, but it doesn't provide any information about the departure time of the bus.

However, if we consider both statements together, we can deduce the departure time of the bus to the airport. If the scheduled arrival time at the airport is 11:40 a.m. and buses usually depart on time, then we can infer that the bus left for the airport at around 10:40 a.m. (assuming a 70-minute journey).

Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer.

Here's a summary of the logic for and against each statement being sufficient:

Statement 1:

* Sufficient: No, it doesn't provide any specific information about the departure time of the bus to the airport.
* Insufficient: Yes, it only mentions that buses usually depart on time, but it doesn't provide any specific information about the departure time of the bus to the airport.

Statement 2:

* Sufficient: No, it only mentions the scheduled arrival time at the airport, but it doesn't provide any information about the departure time of the bus.
* Insufficient: Yes, it only mentions the scheduled arrival time at the airport, but it doesn't provide any information about the departure time of the bus.

Both statements together:

* Sufficient: Yes, we can deduce the departure time of the bus to the airport by considering both statements together.
* Insufficient: No, we can't deduce the departure time of the bus to the airport by considering both statements together.

Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer.

[/INST]


Correct answer: A
The question is asking whether Ajay is the only son of Aparna.

Statement 1: Aparna's brother has only one nephew.

* This statement does not provide any information about Aparna's children, so it is not sufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2: Ruhi is Ajay's sister.

* This statement indicates that Ajay has a sister named Ruhi, but it does not provide any information about whether Ajay is the only son of Aparna. Therefore, statement 2 alone is not sufficient to answer the question.

Now, let's consider both statements together:

* We know that Aparna's brother has only one nephew (statement 1), and we know that Ruhi is Ajay's sister (statement 2). This means that Ajay is the only son of Aparna, since he is the only nephew of Aparna's brother. Therefore, both statements together are sufficient to answer the question.

So, the correct option is (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. Statement 1: Aparna's brother has only one nephew.
	* This statement does not provide any information about Aparna's children, so it is not sufficient to answer the question.
2. Statement 2: Ruhi is Ajay's sister.
	* This statement indicates that Ajay has a sister named Ruhi, but it does not provide any information about whether Ajay is the only son of Aparna. Therefore, statement 2 alone is not sufficient to answer the question.
3. Both statements together:
	* We know that Aparna's brother has only one nephew (statement 1), and we know that Ruhi is Ajay's sister (statement 2). This means that Ajay is the only son of Aparna, since he is the only nephew of Aparna's brother. Therefore, both statements together are sufficient to answer the question.

So, the answer is (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Correct answer: C
There are two statements given:

1. Kavya, who is fifth from the left end, is ninth to the left of Aadesh who is seventh from the right end.
2. Jagrav is eighth to the right of Neerja, who is sixteenth from the right end and fifth from the left end.

We need to determine which of the following options is the correct answer:

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Let's analyze each statement and determine whether it is sufficient to answer the question:

Statement 1: Kavya, who is fifth from the left end, is ninth to the left of Aadesh who is seventh from the right end.

This statement provides us with two pieces of information:

* Kavya is fifth from the left end.
* Aadesh is seventh from the right end.

From this information, we can conclude that Kavya is ninth to the left of Aadesh. However, we still don't know how many students are sitting in a row facing the board.

Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2: Jagrav is eighth to the right of Neerja, who is sixteenth from the right end and fifth from the left end.

This statement provides us with two pieces of information:

* Neerja is sixteenth from the right end and fifth from the left end.
* Jagrav is eighth to the right of Neerja.

From this information, we can conclude that Neerja is sitting in the sixteenth position from the right end, and Jagrav is sitting in the twenty-fourth position from the right end.

Therefore, statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Now, let's consider both statements together:

From statement 1, we know that Kavya is ninth to the left of Aadesh.
From statement 2, we know that Neerja is sixteenth from the right end and Jagrav is twenty-fourth from the right end.

By combining both statements, we can conclude that there are sixteen students sitting in a row facing the board, including Neerja and Jagrav. We can also determine Kavya's position as fifth from the left end.

Therefore, the correct answer is option (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

In summary, statement 1 alone is insufficient, statement 2 alone is sufficient, and both statements taken together provide sufficient information to answer the question. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer.

Correct answer: B
In this game, the colors are mixed up, and we need to determine the color of a fresh tomato.

Statement 1: In the game, blue is called green, white is called black, brown is called purple.

Logic for sufficiency:

* Blue is not mentioned in the question, so we can ignore it.
* White is called black, which means that black is not the color of the fresh tomato.
* Brown is called purple, which means that purple is not the color of the fresh tomato.

Logic against sufficiency:

* We cannot determine the color of the fresh tomato with certainty as there is no direct mention of it in the statement.

Statement 2: In the game, yellow is called white, red is called orange, and green is called brown.

Logic for sufficiency:

* Yellow is not mentioned in the question, so we can ignore it.
* Red is called orange, which means that orange is not the color of the fresh tomato.
* Green is called brown, which means that brown is not the color of the fresh tomato.

Logic against sufficiency:

* Same as statement 1, we cannot determine the color of the fresh tomato with certainty as there is no direct mention of it in the statement.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Logic:

* Statement 1 provides some information about the colors, but it doesn't directly mention the color of the fresh tomato. Therefore, it is not sufficient on its own.
* Statement 2 also doesn't mention the color of the fresh tomato directly, but it provides more information about the colors than statement 1. However, it is also not sufficient on its own.

(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Logic:

* Statement 2 provides more information about the colors than statement 1, but it doesn't mention the color of the fresh tomato directly. Therefore, it is not sufficient on its own.
* Statement 1 doesn't provide much information about the colors, but it mentions that white is called black, which means that black is not the color of the fresh tomato. Therefore, statement 1 is insufficient.

(C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Logic:

* Statement 1 doesn't provide much information about the colors, but it mentions that white is called black, which means that black is not the color of the fresh tomato.
* Statement 2 provides more information about the colors, but it doesn't mention the color of the fresh tomato directly.
* Together, statement 1 and statement 2 provide some information about the colors, but they don't directly mention the color of the fresh tomato. Therefore, either statement 1 or statement 2 is not sufficient.

(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Logic:

* Statement 1 and statement 2 together provide enough information to determine the color of the fresh tomato.
* From statement 1, we know that white is called black, which means that black is not the color of the fresh tomato.
* From statement 2, we know that red is called orange, which means that orange is not the color of the fresh tomato.
* Therefore, the only color left that has not been mentioned is green, which means that the color of the fresh tomato is green.

(E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Logic:

* Statement 1 and statement 2 alone are not sufficient as they don't directly mention the color of the fresh tomato.
* When taken together, statement 1 and statement 2 provide enough information to determine the color of the fresh tomato. Therefore, option E is false.

Conclusion:

The correct option is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Explanation:

* Statement 1 provides some information about the colors, and statement 2 provides more information about the colors.
* When taken together, they provide enough information to determine the color of the fresh tomato, which is green.

Therefore, the answer is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

<s>[INST]Kubera, the wealthy king of the Yakshas, liked all things made of gold and silver. The king decided to gift every Yaksha family a spherical globe made of solid gold with a cylindrical silver rod passing through its center. His goldsmith told him that this would require a 6 cm long, perfectly cylindrical hole to be bored through each perfectly spherical golden globe in order to insert the silver piece. Only the gold surrounding the curved surface of the silver cylinder would be retained. Kubera wanted the silver rod to be inserted but he was worried that gold was going to have to be removed from each of the globes. The goldsmith assured him that there would still be a fair bit of gold still left after the drilling.
What was the remaining volume of the golden globe, after drilling, when it was ready to be inserted with the silver rod?
Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Each silver rod was perfectly aligned perfectly with the vertical axis of the globe.
2. The diameter of the silver rod was exactly 1.25 cm.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (F) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(F). The question can be answered without either statement.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: F
Option (D) is the correct answer.

Statement 1 alone is not sufficient because it does not provide any information about the size or shape of the silver rod, which is necessary to determine the remaining volume of the golden globe.

Statement 2 alone is not sufficient because it only provides the diameter of the silver rod, which is not enough to determine the volume of the remaining gold.

Both statements together are sufficient because they provide both the size and shape of the silver rod, which is necessary to determine the remaining volume of the golden globe.

The logic for and against each statement being sufficient is as follows:

Statement 1:

* For: Provides information about the alignment of the silver rod, which is necessary to determine the volume of the remaining gold.
* Against: Does not provide any information about the size or shape of the silver rod, which is necessary to determine the volume of the remaining gold.

Statement 2:

* For: Provides information about the diameter of the silver rod, which is necessary to determine the volume of the remaining gold.
* Against: Does not provide any information about the alignment of the silver rod, which is necessary to determine the volume of the remaining gold.

Statement 1 and Statement 2 together:

* For: Provides information about both the alignment and diameter of the silver rod, which is necessary to determine the volume of the remaining gold.
* Against: None.

Therefore, Option (D) is the correct answer.

Correct answer: D
Option A is incorrect because statement 1 alone does not provide any information about the number of pages read on Thursday. It only provides information about the number of pages read after lunch on Friday.

Option B is also incorrect because statement 2 alone does not provide any information about the number of pages read on Thursday. It only provides information about the total number of pages in the book and the number of pages read by Wednesday.

Option C is incorrect because neither statement 1 nor statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question. Statement 1 does not provide any information about the number of pages read on Thursday, while statement 2 does not provide any information about the number of pages read on Thursday specifically.

Option D is incorrect because while both statements together provide some information about the number of pages read, they do not provide enough information to determine the exact number of pages read on Thursday.

Option E is the correct option. Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together are sufficient to answer the question because:

* Statement 1 only provides information about the number of pages read after lunch on Friday, not on Thursday.
* Statement 2 only provides information about the total number of pages in the book and the number of pages read by Wednesday, not on Thursday.
* Even if we combine both statements, we still don't have enough information to determine the number of pages read on Thursday. We know that some pages were read after lunch on Friday, and we know that some pages were read by Wednesday, but we don't know how many pages were read on Thursday.

Therefore, option E is the correct answer.

1. Karan said that he had one sister.
2. Jhanvi said that she had one brother.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
The question asks how Karan is related to Jhanvi.

Statement 1: Karan said that he had one sister.

This statement does not provide enough information to determine how Karan is related to Jhanvi. Karan could have multiple sisters, and Jhanvi could be any one of them. Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Statement 2: Jhanvi said that she had one brother.

This statement does not provide enough information to determine how Karan is related to Jhanvi either. Jhanvi could have multiple brothers, and Karan could be any one of them. Therefore, statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Now, let's consider both statements together:

Statement 1 and Statement 2:

Karan said that he had one sister, and Jhanvi said that she had one brother.

From statement 1, we know that Karan has one sister. From statement 2, we know that Jhanvi has one brother. If we combine these two statements, we can conclude that Karan's sister is Jhanvi, and therefore, Karan is Jhanvi's brother.

Therefore, the correct option is (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

The logic for this option is that both statements provide relevant information about the relationship between Karan and Jhanvi. Statement 1 states that Karan has a sister, and statement 2 states that Jhanvi has a brother. By combining these two statements, we can conclude that Karan's sister is Jhanvi, and therefore, Karan is Jhanvi's brother.

The other options do not accurately describe the sufficiency of the given statements:

 Option (A): Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 does not provide enough information to determine how Karan is related to Jhanvi. We need statement 2 to confirm that Jhanvi has a brother, which helps us identify Karan as her brother.

Option (B): Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 2 does not provide enough information to determine how Karan is related to Jhanvi. We need statement 1 to confirm that Karan has a sister, which helps us identify Jhanvi as his sister.

Option (C): Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because both statements are required to determine the relationship between Karan and Jhanvi.

Option (E): Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because we have shown that statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to determine the relationship between Karan and Jhanvi.

Therefore, the correct option is (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

2. The youngest child is a boy and he has 3 sisters.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
There are 4 children in the family. Let'racy G, B, M, and E' Denote the number of girls as 'G' and the number of boys as 'B'. We know that G + B = 4.

Statement 1:
Each girl has twice as many sisters as brothers.

From this statement, we can conclude that G/2 = B, which means G = 2B. 

Now we have two equations: G + B = 4 and G = 2B. Solving these equations, we get G = 2 and B = 2. 

Hence, we can determine the number of girls in the family, so statement 1 alone is sufficient.

Statement 2:
The Youngest child is a boy, and he has three sisters.

From this statement, we know that there are three girls in the family, and the youngest child is a boy. 
So, we can say that G = 3 and B = 1.

We still have the same equation G + B = 4, which is not sufficient to determine the value of G.

Therefore, statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Now let's evaluate the options:

Option (A): Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
This is correct since we have shown that statement 1 alone is sufficient, but statement 2 alone is not sufficient.
Therefore, the correct option is (A).

So, the correct answer is (A): Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: A


<s>[INST]At the finals of the All India Logic competition, the announcer displays six words:  MOSS, DRAG, CULT, CHOP, TRIM, GUTS. Each of the 4 finalists, representing the 4 regional champions within India (North, South, East & West), is given an envelope. Each of those 4 envelopes bear one distinct letter from one of those six words. All those distinct letters in the three envelopes are chosen from the same word. The contestants are forbidden from disclosing the letter in their envelope to anybody else. Each contestant has to determine the chosen word from the list of six.
The announcer asks the Eastern contestant, Durga, whether she can deduce the word. She instantly replies, “Yes!” Without asking her to identify the word, the announcer now moves to the regional champion from the North, Lakshmi and asks her whether she can identify the word. She thinks for a few seconds and then breaks into a smile, “Yes, I know the word.”
What is the word?
Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1.After Lakshmi, the announcer now looks at the contestant from the West and asks, “Saraswati , what about you?” Within moments, she too breaks into a smile and nods, “I know the word!”
2. The last person to answer is Meenakshi. She says, “Now I also know the word.”

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
Option (D) is the correct answer.

Statement 1 alone is not sufficient because it only tells us that Lakshmi knows the word, but it doesn't give us any information about the word itself.

Statement 2 alone is not sufficient because it only tells us that Meenakshi also knows the word, but it doesn't give us any information about the word itself.

However, taking both statements together, we can deduce the word. Here's why:

* Statement 1 tells us that Lakshmi knows the word.
* Statement 2 tells us that Meenakshi also knows the word.
* Since all four contestants have the same word in their envelopes, and two of them (Lakshmi and Meenakshi) know the word, it means that the word is not unique to any one of them.
* Therefore, the word must be a common word that all four contestants know.

The only common word among the six given words that all four contestants would know is "GUTS." Therefore, the word is "GUTS."

So, option (D) is the correct answer, as statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to deduce the word.

(F). The question can be answered without either statement.

Let's evaluate each option:

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient:

If statement 1 is true, it means Vighnesh likes computer programming. However, we cannot conclude that Vighnesh likes playing video games without statement 2. Therefore, statement 1 alone is not sufficient to answer the question.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient:

If statement 2 is true, it means Vighnesh likes computer programming and playing video games. Therefore, statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient:

We have already determined that statement 2 alone is sufficient. Therefore, this option is correct.

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient:

If both statements are true, it means Vighnesh likes computer programming and playing video games. Therefore, this option is also correct.

(F). The question can be answered without either statement:

This option is incorrect because we need at least one of the statements to answer the question.

[/INST]


Correct answer: B
Answer: The correct option is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Here's why:

Statement 1: A is not lighter than C.

This statement tells us that A weighs at least as much as C. It doesn't tell us anything about the relative weights of A and B. Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient to determine whether A is heavier than B.

Statement 2: D weighs the same as A and B is heavier than D.

This statement tells us that D weighs the same as A, and B is heavier than D. Therefore, B is also heavier than A.

Taken together, statements 1 and 2 tell us that A weighs at least as much as C and B is heavier than D, which means that B is heavier than A. Therefore, the correct option is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. Statement 1: A is not lighter than C.
	* Sufficient: No (doesn't tell us anything about A vs. B)
	* Insufficient: Yes (we still don't know whether A is heavier than B)
2. Statement 2: D weighs the same as A and B is heavier than D.
	* Sufficient: Yes (tells us that B is heavier than A)
	* Insufficient: No (we already know that B is heavier than D, but we don't know whether A is heavier than B)
3. Statements 1 and 2 taken together:
	* Sufficient: Yes (we now know that A weighs at least as much as C and B is heavier than D, which means B is heavier than A)
	* Insufficient: No (we still don't know whether A is heavier than B)

Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
The question is asking which word in the code language means 'leaf'.

Let's analyze the two statements:

1. 'apo fu qe nane' means 'mango leaf is long' and 'nane ko' means 'long stick'.
This statement doesn't reveal anything about the word for 'leaf' directly. However, it suggests that 'nane' might refer to a long, thin object, which could potentially be a leaf. But we can't be certain without more information.
2. 'apo qe lans' means 'green mango leaf' and 'ka lans' means 'green book'.
This statement reveals that 'lans' means 'green', and 'apo qe lans' specifically refers to a 'green mango leaf'. This implies that 'apo' might be the word for 'leaf' in the code language.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
We've seen that statement 1 doesn't provide enough information to determine the word for 'leaf'. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
We've seen that statement 2 provides some information about the word for 'leaf', namely that it might be 'apo'. However, we can't be certain without more information. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

(C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
We've seen that statement 1 doesn't provide enough information, and statement 2 provides some but not enough information. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
When we combine the two statements, we get a clearer picture. From statement 1, we know that 'nane' might refer to a long, thin object, and from statement 2, we know that 'apo' might be the word for 'leaf'. This combination of information suggests that 'apo' could indeed mean 'leaf'. Therefore, this option is correct.

(E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
We've seen that both statements provide some information, albeit incomplete, about the word for 'leaf'. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

The correct option is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

[/INST]


Correct answer: D
In this question, we are asked to determine on which date of the month Jayant was born in December 2012.

Let's analyze each statement and determine whether it is sufficient to answer the question.

Statement 1: "Jayant's birthday is on an even date of the month."

This statement alone is not sufficient to answer the question because it does not provide any specific information about the date of Jayant's birthday. There are multiple even dates in December 2012, so we need more information to narrow down the possible dates.

Statement 2: "The day of the month on which Jayant was born is a prime number."

This statement alone is sufficient to answer the question. A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that is divisible only by 1 and itself. There are only three prime numbers in December 2012: 3, 11, and 17. Therefore, if we know that Jayant's birthday is on a prime number, we can conclude that he was born on either December 3, 11, or 17.

Now, let's consider the options:

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone is not sufficient to answer the question.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

This option is correct. Statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question because it narrows down the possible dates to three prime numbers in December 2012.

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 alone is not sufficient, and statement 2 alone is sufficient.

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 1 does not provide any additional information that would help narrow down the possible dates.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

This option is incorrect because statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Therefore, the correct option is (B): Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
Option E is the correct answer.

Here's why:

Statement 1 alone is not sufficient because it doesn't provide any information about the initial amount of water in the tank or the capacity of the tank. It only tells us that seven-twelfths of the tank is filled in half an hour, but we don't know what fraction of the tank was already filled before that.

Statement 2 alone is not sufficient because it only tells us when the pump was turned on, not how long it took to fill the tank.

Together, statements 1 and 2 are sufficient because we can use the information from statement 1 to determine the rate at which the tank is filled, and the information from statement 2 to determine the time it took to fill the tank.

Let's go through the options:

Option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient.

This is incorrect because statement 1 doesn't provide enough information to determine the time it took to fill the tank. We need statement 2 to determine the time.

Option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient.

This is incorrect because statement 2 only tells us when the pump was turned on, not how long it took to fill the tank. We need statement 1 to determine the rate at which the tank is filled.

Option C: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

This is incorrect because we need both statements to determine the time it took to fill the tank.

Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

This is incorrect because we don't need both statements to determine the time it took to fill the tank. We can use either statement 1 or statement 2 to determine the rate at which the tank is filled, and then use the other statement to determine the time it took to fill the tank.

Therefore, the correct option is E: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

The correct answer is Option E.

Correct answer: D
Option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

 logic for:

* Statement 1 provides the rate at which the CEO spoke, which can be used to calculate the total number of words spoken.
* Knowing the total number of words spoken and the rate at which the CEO spoke, we can calculate the duration of the speech.

 logic against:

* Statement 1 does not provide any information about the total number of words spoken or the duration of the speech.
* Without additional information, we cannot calculate the duration of the speech using only statement 1.

Option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

 logic for:

* Statement 2 provides information about the duration of the speech, stating that it would have lasted 4 more minutes if the CEO had spoken 5 fewer words per minute.
* We can use this information to calculate the total number of words spoken and then use statement 1 to calculate the duration of the speech.

 logic against:

* Statement 2 only provides information about the difference in duration between the actual speech and a hypothetical speech with 5 fewer words per minute.
* Without additional information, we cannot calculate the actual duration of the speech using only statement 2.

Option C: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

 logic for:

* Statement 1 provides information about the rate at which the CEO spoke, which can be used to calculate the total number of words spoken.
* Statement 2 provides information about the duration of the speech, stating that it would have lasted 4 more minutes if the CEO had spoken 5 fewer words per minute.
* Either statement can be used independently to calculate the duration of the speech.

 logic against:

* Neither statement provides enough information on its own to calculate the duration of the speech.
* Statement 1 does not provide any information about the total number of words spoken or the duration of the speech.
* Statement 2 only provides information about the difference in duration between the actual speech and a hypothetical speech with 5 fewer words per minute.

Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

 logic for:

* Statement 1 provides information about the rate at which the CEO spoke.
* Statement 2 provides information about the duration of the speech, stating that it would have lasted 4 more minutes if the CEO had spoken 5 fewer words per minute.
* Together, these statements provide enough information to calculate the total number of words spoken and the duration of the speech.

 logic against:

* Neither statement provides enough information on its own to calculate the duration of the speech.
* Taking both statements together does not provide any additional information that would make it possible to calculate the duration of the speech.

Option E: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

 logic for:

* Statement 1 does not provide any information about the total number of words spoken or the duration of the speech.
* Statement 2 only provides information about the difference in duration between the actual speech and a hypothetical speech with 5 fewer words per minute.
* Taking both statements together does not provide enough information to calculate the duration of the speech.

 logic against:

* This option is incorrect, as there is a way to calculate the duration of the speech using both statements together.

The correct option is D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

By using both statements together, we can calculate the total number of words spoken and the duration of the speech. Statement 1 provides the rate at which the CEO spoke, which can be used to calculate the total number of words spoken. Statement 2 provides information about the duration of the speech, stating that it would have lasted 4 more minutes if the CEO had spoken 5 fewer words per minute. Using this information, we can calculate the duration of the speech. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.

Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
тAnswer: D. Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Logic:

Statement 1: X's father has 3 children.

* This statement alone is not sufficient to answer the question because it doesn't mention Devi or her daughters.

Statement 2: Y is X's sister and daughter of Devi.

* This statement alone is not sufficient to answer the question because it doesn't mention how many daughters Devi has.

Combining both statements:

* Statement 1 tells us that X's father has 3 children, and statement 2 tells us that Y is one of those children and is also Devi's daughter. Therefore, we can conclude that Devi has at least one daughter, Y.
* We still don't know if Devi has any other daughters besides Y, so we can't answer the question fully.

Therefore, the correct option is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

<s>[INST]Among 5 friends - Anjali, Arun, Ritika, Vishwesh and Kartik, who is the tallest? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Anjali is taller than Arun and Kartik.
2. Arun is shorter than Ritika but taller than Vishwesh.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
The question asks who is the tallest among 5 friends: Anjali, Arun, Ritika, Vishwesh, and Kartik. We are given two statements:

1. Anjali is taller than Arun and Kartik.
2. Arun is shorter than Ritika but taller than Vishwesh.

We need to determine which statement(s) are sufficient to answer the question.

Let's analyze each statement:

Statement 1: Anjali is taller than Arun and Kartik.

This statement tells us that Anjali is taller than two people, but it doesn't give us enough information to determine who the tallest person is among all five friends. For example, if Ritika is taller than Anjali, then Ritika would be the tallest. Therefore, Statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Statement 2: Arun is shorter than Ritika but taller than Vishwesh.

This statement gives us more information about Arun's height but doesn't directly help us determine who the tallest person is. However, it does tell us that Ritika is taller than Arun, which means Ritika is taller than at least two people (Anjali and Arun). This makes Ritika a potential candidate for the tallest person. However, we still don't know if Ritika is taller than Kartik or Vishwesh. Therefore, Statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Now, let's consider both statements together:

When we combine both statements, we get a clearer picture. We know that Anjali is taller than Arun and Kartik, and Ritika is taller than Arun. This means that the tallest person among Anjali, Arun, and Kartik is Anjali. However, we still don't know if Ritika or Vishwesh is taller than Anjali.

Therefore, the correct option is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient. Together, the statements allow us to deduce that Anjali is the tallest among the five friends.

In summary, Statement 1 alone is insufficient because it only gives us partial information about Anjali's height. Statement 2 alone is insufficient because it only gives us partial information about Arun's height. However, when we combine both statements, we can conclude that Anjali is the tallest among the five friends. Therefore, the correct option is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
Option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

 logic for:

* Statement 1 establishes a direct relationship between X and Z, indicating that X's father is married to Z.
* This means that Z is X's stepmother or stepfather, which makes Y, Z's daughter, X's stepsister.
* Therefore, statement 1 alone is sufficient to establish the relationship between X and Y.

logic against:

* Statement 2 does not provide any information about X's relationship with Y.
* Without statement 2, we cannot determine the relationship between X and Y.

Option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

logic for:

* Statement 2 establishes a direct relationship between Y and Z, indicating that Z is Y's mother.
* This means that Z's son or daughter is Y's sibling, which makes X, Z's son or daughter, Y's sibling.
* Therefore, statement 2 alone is sufficient to establish the relationship between X and Y.

logic against:

* Statement 1 does not provide any information about Y's relationship with X.
* Without statement 1, we cannot determine the relationship between X and Y.

Option C: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

logic for:

* Statement 1 establishes a direct relationship between X and Z, which makes Z X's stepparent.
* Statement 2 establishes a direct relationship between Y and Z, which makes Z Y's parent.
* Either statement alone is sufficient to establish the relationship between X and Y.

logic against:

* Neither statement alone provides the complete picture of the relationship between X and Y.

Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

logic for:

* Statement 1 establishes a direct relationship between X and Z.
* Statement 2 establishes a direct relationship between Y and Z.
* Together, statements 1 and 2 establish that X and Y have a shared parent (Z), making them siblings.

logic against:

* Statements 1 and 2 do not provide enough information to determine the relationship between X and Y without each other.

Option E: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

logic for:

* Statements 1 and 2 provide some information about X's and Y's relationships with Z, but they do not provide enough information to determine the relationship between X and Y.

logic against:

* Statements 1 and 2 alone do not provide enough information to determine the relationship between X and Y.
* Taken together, statements 1 and 2 still do not provide enough information to determine the relationship between X and Y.

Conclusion:
The correct option is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Explanation:
Both statement 1 and statement 2 are required to establish the relationship between X and Y. Statement 1 establishes the relationship between X and Z, while statement 2 establishes the relationship between Y and Z. Together, they establish that X and Y have a shared parent (Z), making them siblings. Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
Option (D) is the correct answer.

Here's why:

Statement 1: A plays hockey.

This statement alone is not sufficient to determine who plays cricket. We can infer that A does not play cricket, but we don't know who among B, C, and D plays cricket.

Statement 2: C plays neither chess nor football.

This statement alone is not sufficient to determine who plays cricket. We can infer that C does not play chess or football, but we still don't know who among A, B, and D plays cricket.

Combining the two statements, we can conclude that:

* A plays hockey, so A does not play cricket.
* C does not play chess or football, so C does not play cricket.
* B and D are the only remaining players who can play cricket.

Therefore, either B or D plays cricket. We cannot determine who specifically plays cricket without additional information.

So, the correct answer is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
The question asks how much a clock loses in a day. To answer this question, we need to know the clock's rate of loss, which is not explicitly given in the statements.

Let's evaluate each statement and determine whether it is sufficient to answer the question.

Statement 1: The clock shows 7:45 a.m.

This statement alone is insufficient to answer the question. It only tells us the time on the clock at a particular moment, but we need to know the rate at which the clock loses time to determine how much it loses in a day.

Statement 2: The hour and minute hands coincide every 63 minutes starting at noon.

This statement alone is sufficient to answer the question. Knowing that the hour and minute hands coincide every 63 minutes allows us to calculate the clock's rate of loss. Since the clock loses 1 hour every 12 hours, it loses 1/12 of an hour every 63 minutes. Therefore, in a day (24 hours), the clock loses 24/12 = 2 hours.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

This is incorrect. Statement 1 is insufficient on its own, and statement 2 is sufficient on its own.

(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

This is incorrect. Statement 1 is insufficient on its own, and statement 2 is sufficient on its own.

(C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

This is incorrect. Statement 1 is insufficient on its own, and statement 2 is sufficient on its own.

(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

This is incorrect. Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together do not provide any additional information that would make the answer more precise.

(E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

This is incorrect. Statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

The correct option is (B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Therefore, the answer to the question "How much does a clock lose in a day?" is 2 hours.
Given answer: B

[/INST]


Correct answer: A

The question asks for the number of tabla instructors teaching in the city, and we need to determine which of the two given statements is sufficient to answer this question.

Statement 1: There is one tabla instructor for each of the 52 classes held in this city.

* Sufficient: This statement alone is sufficient to answer the question. If there is one instructor for each class, then the number of instructors is equal to the number of classes, which is 52.
* Insufficient: This statement does not provide any information about the number of students per instructor or the total number of students.

Statement 2: Each tabla instructor teaches 5 students.

* Sufficient: This statement alone is not sufficient to answer the question. We need to know the total number of students to determine the number of instructors.
* Insufficient: This statement provides the information that each instructor teaches 5 students, but we need to know the total number of students to determine the number of instructors.

Now let's consider the options:

(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

* Correct: Statement 1 provides the information that there is one instructor for each class, so the number of instructors is equal to the number of classes, which is 52. Statement 2 doesn't provide any information about the number of instructors.

(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

* Incorrect: Statement 2 alone doesn't provide enough information to determine the number of instructors. We need to know the total number of students to calculate the number of instructors.

(C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

* Incorrect: Statement 1 alone is sufficient, but statement 2 alone is not sufficient. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

* Incorrect: We don't need both statements to determine the number of instructors. Statement 1 alone is sufficient.

(E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

* Incorrect: Statement 1 alone is sufficient, so this option is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct option is (A): Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
Option (D) is the correct answer.

Statement 1 alone is not sufficient to determine which hospital has more male births than female births, as it only provides the overall percentage of male and female births in a given year, but does not provide information about the distribution of births between the two hospitals.

Statement 2 alone is also not sufficient, as it only provides information about the size of the maternity wards in the two hospitals, but does not provide information about the number of births in each hospital.

However, when we combine Statements 1 and 2, we can conclude that the hospital with the larger maternity ward (the one far away) is likely to have more male births than the hospital with the smaller maternity ward (the one near the speaker). This is because the larger maternity ward is likely to have more births overall, and given the percentage of male and female births is roughly equal, it is likely that the hospital with the larger maternity ward will have more male births.

Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer.

Logic for Statement 1 being insufficient:

* Statement 1 only provides the overall percentage of male and female births in a given year.
* It does not provide information about the distribution of births between the two hospitals.
* Therefore, it is not possible to determine which hospital has more male births than female births based on Statement 1 alone.

Logic for Statement 2 being insufficient:

* Statement 2 only provides information about the size of the maternity wards in the two hospitals.
* It does not provide information about the number of births in each hospital.
* Therefore, it is not possible to determine which hospital has more male births than female births based on Statement 2 alone.

Logic for Statements 1 and 2 being sufficient:

* Statement 1 provides the overall percentage of male and female births in a given year.
* Statement 2 provides information about the size of the maternity wards in the two hospitals.
* By combining the two statements, we can infer that the hospital with the larger maternity ward (the one far away) is likely to have more male births than the hospital with the smaller maternity ward (the one near the speaker).
* Therefore, Statements 1 and 2 taken together are sufficient to determine which hospital has more male births than female births.

Conclusion:

Therefore, option (D) is the correct answer. Statements 1 and 2 taken together are sufficient to determine which hospital has more male births than female births, while Statements 1 and 2 alone are not sufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
The question is asking whether A is B's brother.

Statement 1: C is B's spouse.

This statement does not provide any information about A's relationship with B. It only tells us that C is married to B. Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2: A is C's relative.

This statement tells us that A is related to C, but it does not necessarily mean that A is B's brother. A could be C's sibling, parent, or any other relative. Therefore, statement 2 alone is insufficient to answer the question.

Now, let's consider both statements taken together:

Statement 1: C is B's spouse.
Statement 2: A is C's relative.

Together, these statements suggest that A is related to C, who is married to B. This implies that A is also related to B, which means that A could be B's brother. However, we still cannot conclusively say that A is B's brother without additional information.

Therefore, the correct option is (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Logic for and against each statement being sufficient:

Statement 1:

* For: Provides information about B's spouse, which could potentially help in determining A's relationship with B.
* Against: Does not directly provide information about A's relationship with B.

Statement 2:

* For: Provides information about A's relationship with C, which could potentially help in determining A's relationship with B.
* Against: Does not directly provide information about A's relationship with B.

Both statements taken together:

* For: Provides information about A's relationship with C and C's relationship with B, which can help in determining A's relationship with B.
* Against: Does not directly state that A is B's brother, and there could be other possible relationships between A and B that are not explicitly ruled out.

Conclusion:
The correct option is (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to answer the question. While neither statement alone provides sufficient information to determine A's relationship with B, combining the two statements allows us to infer that A is related to B, and could potentially be B's brother.

Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
The question is asking us to determine which statement(s) are sufficient to answer the question of how many fans went to the stadium yesterday.

Let's evaluate each statement and examine their sufficiency:

1. Statement 1: In total, 2343 single-person tickets were bought.

This statement is insufficient to answer the question because it doesn't provide information about how many fans actually attended the stadium. It only tells us the number of tickets sold, and we don't know how many of those tickets were bought by individuals who attended the game alone or with others. Therefore, this statement alone cannot answer the question.

2. Statement 2: The stadium can seat 2600 fans.

This statement is also insufficient to answer the question because it only provides information about the maximum capacity of the stadium. It doesn't tell us how many fans actually attended the game. Therefore, this statement alone cannot answer the question.

Now, let's consider both statements together:

When we combine both statements, we can infer that at least 2343 fans attended the game, since that's the number of single-person tickets sold. However, we still don't know how many fans attended the game in total, as we don't have information about how many tickets were bought by groups or families.

Therefore, the correct answer is option (D): Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

This option is correct because, when we consider both statements, we can infer the minimum number of fans who attended the game (2343), but we still don't have exact information about the total number of fans who attended.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
Option (D) is the correct answer.

Statement 1: M is not younger than P and O is older than N.

From this statement, we know that M and P are not in any particular order, and O is older than N. This means that O could be the oldest, or M and P could be older than O, but we cannot determine that without further information. Therefore, this statement alone is insufficient to answer the question.

Statement 2: P is older than exactly two friends.

From this statement, we know that P is older than two friends, but we don't know who those friends are. Without knowing the identities of the friends P is older than, we cannot determine who is older than O. Therefore, this statement alone is insufficient to answer the question.

Combining the two statements, we know that M and P are not in any particular order, O is older than N, and P is older than exactly two friends. We can deduce that O is older than N and M, but we still cannot determine who is older between P and O. Therefore, combining the two statements is also insufficient to answer the question.

Therefore, the correct answer is option (D), Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient, but neither statement alone is sufficient.

Here's a diagram to illustrate the relationships between the friends, using the information provided:

M < P (not younger than)
O > N (older than)
P > 2 friends (older than exactly two friends)

The diagram shows that there are several possible configurations that satisfy the given information, but none of them allow us to determine who is older between P and O. Therefore, we need both statements to deduce that O is older than P.

Correct answer: C
Ravi is ranked 22 from the top in a class. To find his rank from the bottom, we need to know the total number of students in the class.

Let's evaluate each statement and determine if it is sufficient to answer the question.

Statement 1: The rank list ends with rank 56.

This statement alone is insufficient to answer the question. We know that Ravi is ranked 22 from the top, but we don't know the total number of students in the class. Without knowing the total number of students, we cannot determine Ravi's rank from the bottom.

Statement 2: Kumar ranks 10th but is 47th from the bottom.

This statement alone is sufficient to answer the question. We know that Kumar is 47th from the bottom, and he ranks 10th. Therefore, the total number of students in the class is 57 (47 + 10). Now, we can calculate Ravi's rank from the bottom: 57 - 22 = 35.

Therefore, the correct option is (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Here's a breakdown of the other options:

(A) Statement 1 alone is insufficient, as mentioned above.

(C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient. This is incorrect because statement 1 alone is insufficient, and statement 2 alone is sufficient.

(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient. This is incorrect because statement 1 doesn't provide any information about the total number of students in the class, and statement 2 alone is sufficient.

(E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient. This is incorrect because statement 2 alone is sufficient.
Given answer: E


<s>[INST]Socks P, Q, R, S, T and U form 3 pairs. P pairs with neither Q nor R. What are the pairs? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Neither S nor T pairs with either Q or R.
2. Neither P nor Q pairs with either S or U.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.

Correct answer: D

The question asks for the pairs formed by socks P, Q, R, S, T, and U, with the additional information that P does not pair with Q or R.

Let's analyze the statements:

1. Neither S nor T pairs with either Q or R.

If this statement is true, then we can deduce that S and T pair with each other, as they do not pair with Q or R. This leaves P, Q, and R to form the remaining two pairs. However, we cannot determine which of these three socks pair with each other without additional information. Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient.

2. Neither P nor Q pairs with either S or U.

If this statement is true, then we can deduce that P and Q pair with each other, as they do not pair with S or U. This leaves S, T, and U to form the remaining two pairs. Again, we cannot determine which of these three socks pair with each other without additional information. Therefore, statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Now, let's consider both statements together:

If both statements are true, then we have the following information:

* P pairs with neither Q nor R.
* S and T pair with each other.
* Neither P nor Q pairs with either S or U.

With this information, we can deduce the following pairs:

* P and R
* S and T
* Q and U

Therefore, the correct option is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

The logic for this option is as follows:

* Statement 1 eliminates P-Q and P-R as possible pairs, leaving P-R and S-T as the only remaining pairs.
* Statement 2 eliminates P-S and P-U as possible pairs, leaving P-R and Q-U as the only remaining pairs.
* Combining both statements, we get P-R, S-T, and Q-U as the three pairs, which satisfies the given conditions.

The other options do not lead to a unique solution, and hence are incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is option (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
