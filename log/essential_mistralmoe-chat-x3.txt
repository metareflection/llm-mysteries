1. Cole is under 7 feet tall. 
2. Every player on Cole's varsity basketball team is above 6'1".

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
Let's evaluate the statements one by one:

1. Cole is under 7 feet tall: This statement only establishes an upper limit for Cole's height. It could be anywhere between 0 inches and 6 feet 11 inches. So this statement alone is not sufficient to determine if Cole is over 6 feet tall. We cannot establish a lower limit based on this information. Hence, statement 1 alone is insufficient.

2. Every player on Cole's varsity basketball team is above 6'1": This statement tells us about the other players on the team but not specifically about Cole. However, since it sets a lower limit for all the players on the team, including Cole, it means Cole must be at least 6 feet 1 inch tall. Hence, statement 2 alone is sufficient to determine that Cole is over 6 feet tall.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient. This is because statement 2 provides us with a lower limit for Cole's height, which allows us to conclude that he is taller than 6 feet.
Given answer: B
Success? True


<s>[INST]Does Alice like elephants more than zebras? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Elephants are Alice's favourite animals. 
2. Zebras are the animals that Alice likes the least.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
1. Statement 1 alone: "Elephants are Alice's favorite animals." This statement tells us that Alice has a preference for elephants over other animals, but it doesn't give us any information about her feelings towards zebras specifically. It's possible that she likes zebras quite a bit as well, just not as much as elephants. Based on this statement alone, we cannot definitively say whether Alice likes elephants more than zebras.

2. Statement 2 alone: "Zebras are the animals that Alice likes the least." This statement tells us that Alice has less affection for zebras than any other animals. However, it doesn't provide us with any information about how she feels about elephants relative to zebras. Perhaps she really dislikes zebras, but enjoys elephants just a little bit. Or maybe she doesn't feel strongly about either, but since we know she likes elephants the most (from Statement 1), we can infer that she must like them more than zebras. But based on Statement 2 alone, we cannot definitively say whether Alice likes elephants more than zebras.

Now let's consider the combined implications of both statements:
If elephants are Alice's favorite animals (Statement 1), and zebras are the animals that Alice likes the least (Statement 2), then it stands to reason that Alice must like elephants more than zebras. This conclusion is based on the transitive property: if A is greater than B, and B is less than C, then A is greater than C.

However, even with both statements together, we don't know the degree to which Alice likes elephants or dislikes zebras. It's possible that she really hates zebras and only mildly likes elephants, or she might adore elephants and feel indifferent about zebras. We cannot make a precise comparison of the intensity of her feelings towards each animal based on these statements.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient to determine that Alice likes elephants more than zebras, but not to determine the exact difference in the intensity of her feelings towards each animal.
Given answer: D
Success? False

1. Five students failed. 
2. One student was 29th from the top and 16th from the bottom.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
Statement 1: Five students failed.
This information alone is not enough to determine the total number of students in the classroom because we only know how many failed, not the total number who took the exam. Therefore, statement 1 is insufficient.

Statement 2: One student was 29th from the top and 16th from the bottom.
This means that there are 28 + 15 = 43 students who scored better than this student and 15 students who scored worse, adding up to a total of 43 + 15 + 1 (the student themselves) = 59 students. So, statement 2 is sufficient.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: B
Success? True


<s>[INST]Which direction is Samuel facing in? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Samuel is not facing North. 
2. Samuel is facing the sun.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E

First, let's consider statement 1: "Samuel is not facing North." This statement means that Samuel could be facing in any direction except for North. However, we don't have enough information to determine his exact direction based solely on this information. Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient. Option A can be eliminated.

Next,  let's consider statement 2: "Samuel is facing the sun." The position of the sun changes depending on the time of day and the location on Earth, so it would help us to know this information in order to determine Samuel's direction. If we know that the sun is in a specific position, then we can deduce Samuel's direction. Therefore, statement 2 alone is potentially sufficient, but we need more information to confirm.

Now, let's consider both statements together. We still don't know the exact position of the sun, so knowing that Samuel is not facing North is not helpful. We cannot definitively determine Samuel's direction based on these two statements. Therefore, statements 1 and 2 together are insufficient as well. Option D can be eliminated.

Given that statement 1 is insufficient individually and doesn't add any value when combined with statement 2, the correct answer is B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient, while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Final answer: (B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: B
Success? False

1. There are no red balls in the basket. 
2. The smallest ball in the basket is green.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Logic for:
1. If there are no red balls in the basket, it means that all the balls are not red. The question asks about the color of the balls in the basket, and not having red balls doesn't confirm that they are only blue. However, this statement does not confirm the presence of any other specific color such as blue. But it narrows down the possibility of colors in the basket which could contain other colors but no red ones.
2. Statement 2 is insufficient because, even if the smallest ball is green, it does not tell us anything about the other balls in the basket. They could be of any other color and not necessarily blue.

Logic against:
Can't think of any logical argument against statement 1 being insufficient on its own, since it doesn't directly answer the question about only blue balls being in the basket.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Logic for:
1. Cannot consider statement 2 as sufficient. The smallest ball being green doesn't exclude the possibility of other colors being present in the basket.
2. Statement 1 is insufficient because, just like in option A, this statement does not confirm the presence of only blue balls.

Logic against:
Can't think of any logical argument against statement 2 being insufficient on its own, since it doesn't directly answer the question about only blue balls being in the basket.

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Logic for:
1. Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 alone is sufficient, as discussed in options A and B.

Logic against:
As mentioned before, neither statement directly answers the question about only blue balls being in the basket, so we cannot conclude that just one of the statements is sufficient.

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Logic for:
1. When both statements are considered together, it still doesn't confirm that only blue balls are in the basket.

Logic against:
Neither statement addresses the presence of blue balls, so they cannot be sufficient when taken together.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Logic for:
1. Statements 1 and 2 do not explicitly confirm the presence of only blue balls, nor do they rule out the possibility of other colors. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

<s>[INST]Does Leonid like carrots? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Leonid hates vegetables.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
Step 1: Analyze Statement 1 - "Leonid hates vegetables."
This statement suggests that Leonid does not like any type of vegetables, which would include carrots. However, it does not directly state whether Leonid likes or dislikes carrots. Therefore, Statement 1 alone is not sufficient to answer the question.

Step 2: Analyze Statement 2 - "Leonid prefers carrots to leeks."
This statement indicates that Leonid has a preference for carrots over leeks, implying that he at least likes carrots more than leeks. However, this statement does not provide information about how Leonid feels about carrots on their own or in comparison to other foods. Thus, Statement 2 alone is not sufficient to answer the question.

Step 3: Analyze both statements together.
When considering both statements together, we know that Leonid prefers carrots to leeks (Statement 2) and he hates vegetables (Statement 1). While Statement 2 implies that Leonid likes carrots more than leeks, it does not necessarily mean that he likes carrots overall. However, since Statement 1 indicates that Leonid hates vegetables, and carrots are considered a vegetable, it is reasonable to infer that Leonid likely does not like carrots.

Therefore, neither Statement 1 nor Statement 2 alone is sufficient to answer the question, but taken together, they provide enough context to infer that Leonid does not like carrots.

The correct answer is: (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
Given answer: D
Success? False

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
1. Statement 1: The probability of event A is 0.55.

Logic for this statement being insufficient:
- We don't have any information about the relationship between events A and B. Without knowing if they are mutually exclusive, independent, or dependent, we cannot determine the probability of event B based on the probability of event A.

Logic against this statement being insufficient:
- No logic against, as the given information is indeed insufficient.

2. Statement 2: The probability of either A or B or both A and B happening is 0.65.

Logic for this statement being sufficient:
- We can use the formula for the union of two probabilities P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) to find the probability of event B, given that we know the probability of both events A and B happening together (P(A ∩ B)).

Logic against this statement being sufficient:
- We don't actually know the probability of P(A ∩ B), so while having the information about the union of A and B might be helpful in some cases, it's not enough to find the exact probability of event B.

Conclusion:
Since neither statement individually provides enough information to determine the probability of event B, but together they do, the correct answer is (D) Statement 1 and Statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
Given answer: D
Success? False

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
Step 1: Analyze the statements.

Statement 1: All buildings with more than 20 floors need a special license.
Statement 2: The building contractor wants to build a 30-storey building.

Step 2: Evaluate each statement for sufficiency.

Statement 1: This statement tells us that if a building has more than 20 floors, it requires a special license. However, we do not know the details about the building contractor or their intentions. Thus, statement 1 alone is not sufficient.

Statement 2: This statement tells us the contractor's plan to build a 30-storey building. However, it does not provide any information about whether a special license is needed or not. Thus, statement 2 alone is not sufficient.

Step 3: Evaluate both statements combined.

When considered together, they imply that the contractor plans to build a 30-storey building, which needs a special license according to statement 1. However, the information about the contractor's intentions is still indirect and not explicitly stated. Therefore, while these statements suggest that a special license may be required, they do not definitively prove it.

Step 4: Choose the correct answer.

Given the ambiguity that remains even when both statements are considered together, the correct option is:

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
Given answer: E
Success? False

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
1. If 5 brick-laying machines work with 5 men the wall will be built in 7.5 hours.

This statement is not sufficient because it gives us information about how the machines work with men, but it does not give us specific information about how fast the machines work on their own.

2. The brick-laying machines work twice as fast as the men.

This statement is not sufficient because it does not give us any information about the actual time it takes for the machines to build the wall, only that they work twice as fast as the men. It relies on the assumption that we know how fast the men are able to build the wall.

Taking both statements into account, we know that the machines work twice as fast as the men, and that when the machines work with 5 men they can build the wall in 7.5 hours. We can now calculate the rate at which the machines work:

If 5 machines and 5 men working together can build the wall in 7.5 hours, then the machines are responsible for building it in half that time (because they work twice as fast), or 3.75 hours. Since the wall takes 6 hours to build with just men, the machines are 1.25 times faster than men. This contradicts the information given in statement 2, so both statements cannot be true at the same time.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
Given answer: E
Success? False

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E

Statement 1 alone is insufficient: We only know the relationship between the number of people in Ramya's and Abhinav's restaurant, but we don't have exact numbers. So, option A is incorrect.

Statement 2 alone is sufficient: If we know the total number of people in both restaurants, and we know that Ramya's restaurant is one of those two, then we can find the number of people in Ramya's restaurant by subtracting the number of people in Abhinav's restaurant (as given by statement 1). Therefore, statement 2 is sufficient, which makes option B correct.

However, since we've already determined a correct answer, we don't need to consider the possibility of both statements together being sufficient. 

Therefore, the correct option is (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: B
Success? False


<s>[INST]Who finished the task in the least amount of time between Liam, Pranav and Salma? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
1. Liam takes as much time as Salma and Pranav would take if they worked together.

This statement alone is not sufficient to determine who finished the task in the least amount of time between Liam, Pranav, and Salma. We do not have any information about how long it would take for Pranav and Salma to complete the task together. It could be that Liam takes the same amount of time as Pranav and Salma working together, or it could be that Liam takes more time than either of them working alone.

2. Salma takes double the amount of time that Pranav and Liam take working together.

This statement alone is also not sufficient to determine who finished the task in the least amount of time between Liam, Pranav, and Salma. This statement only gives us information about Salma's time compared to Pranav and Liam working together, but does not provide any information about Pranav and Liam's individual times or their combined time.

However, when we consider BOTH statements:

* From statement 1, we know that Liam takes as much time as Salma and Pranav working together (let's call this combined time X)
* From statement 2, we know that Salma takes twice as long as Pranav and Liam working together (2X). This also means that Pranav and Liam, working together, take half the time that Salma does (0.5X)
* Based on this, Pranav and Liam working together take the least amount of time, making them the most efficient workers among the three.

Therefore, either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient as long as both statements are considered together. Answer is (C).

Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
1. Statement 1: "There are fewer girls than boys." This statement tells us that there are more boys than girls, but it doesn't give us an exact number for either gender. Since we don't know the exact number of any gender, this statement alone is not sufficient to answer the question.

2. Statement 2: "Each girl has half as many sisters as brothers." This statement can only be true if there is an odd number of boys, because if there were an even number of boys, then the number of sisters would be evenly divisible by two, which means the number of brothers would be even. But this cannot be the case, because there are seven children in total and an even number of boys would mean there are more girls, which contradicts statement 1. Therefore, there must be an odd number of boys, which means there is one boy more than twice the number of girls, i.e., if there were two girls, there would be one boy, if there were four girls, there would be three boys, and so on. Since we now have enough information to deduce that there is at least one boy, this statement is sufficient to answer the question.

Therefore, statement 2 alone is sufficient, and answer is (B). Statement 1 is not needed in this case, but if taken together with statement 2, it doesn't add any new information and still doesn't help reach the conclusion without statement 2.

Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
1. Statement 1 alone: Tony correctly states that Qi's birthday is after 2nd and before 5th March.

This statement is sufficient because it narrows down Qi's birthday to a specific time frame: not on the 2nd (because it's after the 2nd), and not on the 5th (because it's before the 5th). Therefore, Qi's birthday must be one of the days in between, which are March 3rd, 4th, or 3rd to 4th.

2. Statement 2 alone: Brenna incorrectly states that Qi's birthday is on 3rd March.

This statement is insufficient because Brenna's statement contradicts the information provided in statement 1 (by Tony). Since Brenna's statement is incorrect, we cannot rely on it to determine Qi's birthday.

Therefore, the correct option is:
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
Step 1: Analyze Statement 1: "Either Alexia or Jenny is a doctor."
- This statement does not specify who between Alexia and Jenny is the doctor, only that one of them holds that title. Therefore, Statement 1 alone is insufficient to determine if Alexia is a doctor.

Step 2: Analyze Statement 2: "Alexia and Jenny are a doctor and nurse respectively."
- This statement clarifies the roles of both Alexia and Jenny. Consequently, Statement 2 alone is sufficient to determine that Alexia is a doctor.

Step 3: Compare and Conclude:
1. Since Statement 2 is sufficient by itself, there is no need to consider whether taking both statements together would provide any additional information. Thus, analyzing the combination of both statements becomes irrelevant for this question.

Therefore, the correct option is (B): Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

For this statement to be sufficient, we must be able to determine whether there will be more crocodile attacks next year based solely on the information provided. Unfortunately, whether there were more attacks this year than last year does not help in predicting the number of attacks for next year. So, statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Step 2: Analyze statement 2.

(2) 56 people were attacked by crocodiles this year.

This statement gives the number of attacks for only one year and does not provide any context or comparison to previous or future years. Thus, statement 2 alone is insufficient to predict whether there will be more crocodile attacks next year.

Step 3: Analyze the combination of the two statements.

Together, the two statements simply provide information about this year and a comparison between this year and the previous year. However, they do not provide any basis for predicting the number of attacks in the next year. Hence, the combination of statements 1 and 2 also doesn't give us the necessary information.

Step 4: Conclusion.

Of the options available, the only correct answer is:

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

The statements provided do not provide enough context or basis for predicting the number of crocodile attacks in the next year. Hence, none of the options is sufficient.

2. In 1998, the African regional group received the largest fraction of UN aid.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

The nationality of the Secretary General does not provide enough information to determine the size of the African group in the United Nations. It is true that Kofi Annan was from Ghana, an African country, but this does not necessarily mean that African member states formed the largest regional group in the UN in 1999. Statement 1 is not sufficient to answer the question.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Although statement 2 indicates that the African regional group received the largest fraction of UN aid in 1998, it does not necessarily mean that they were the largest regional group in the UN in 1999. Aid distribution may not directly correlate with the number of member states in each regional group. Statement 2 is not sufficient to answer the question.

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 provides sufficient information to answer the question individually, as explained in (A) and (B).

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

When both statements are considered together, there is still not enough information to determine whether African member states formed the largest regional group in the United Nations in 1999. The information about Kofi Annan's nationality and the distribution of UN aid in 1998 does not give details about the composition of the UN regional groups in 1999.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

All the given information is insufficient to conclusively determine if African member states formed the largest regional group in the United Nations in 1999.

Correct answer: (E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
Step 1: Evaluate statement 1.
If x = 3, then we know the exact value of x. So, statement 1 is sufficient to determine x. Therefore, options A and C are possible answers.

Step 2: Evaluate statement 2.
The statement x = x does not give any specific value of x. It only states that x is equal to itself, which is true for all possible values of x. Therefore, statement 2 is not sufficient to determine the exact value of x.

Step 3: Evaluate combining both statements.
Since statement 1 is sufficient on its own, there is no need to consider the combination of statements 1 and 2.

Step 4: Answer the question.
Using the process of elimination, we can deduce that the correct answer is option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient, while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Statement 1 is enough to find the exact value of x, which is 3. Statement 2, however, is an identity statement that does not provide any new information about the value of x. Therefore, statement 1 is the only one that is sufficient. It is possible to solve this question by checking the given options one by one, but it is also helpful to understand the logic behind why the other options are incorrect. The given question requires finding the value of x. Let's evaluate each option:

Option A, which suggests that statement 1 alone is sufficient, is correct. With statement 1, we know that x = 3.

Option B, which suggests that statement 2 alone is sufficient, is incorrect. Statement 2, x = x, does not provide any specific value for x.

Option C, which suggests that either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient, is not entirely correct. We already know that statement 1 alone is sufficient. However, statement 2 is not sufficient on its own.

Option D, which suggests that statements 1 and 2 taken together are sufficient, is not correct. Since statement 1 is sufficient on its own, there is no need to combine it with statement 2 to determine the value of x. However, statement 2 does not contain any new information that helps to further determine the value of x.

Option E, which suggests that neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor the combination of both is sufficient, is not correct. Statement 1 alone is sufficient to determine the value of x.

TheCorrect answer is A, as statement 1 alone is sufficient to determine the value of x.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
To evaluate the sufficiency of each statement, let's consider two scenarios: one where our city has exactly 1000 people and another where our city has a larger population.

Scenario 1: Population of 1000 people
If our city has 1000 people, then Statement 1 would imply that the city needs 100 beds (100 beds per thousand people). Statement 2 tells us that there are 150 beds for these 1000 people.

Scenario 2: Population greater than 1000 people
If our city has more than 1000 people, then both statements become relevant. For example, if our city has 2000 people, Statement 1 requires 200 beds (100 beds per thousand people), and Statement 2 tells us that there are 300 beds available.

Using this information, let's evaluate each option:

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient. Incorrect. In Scenario 1, Statement 2 is actually sufficient to conclude that we have more than enough beds for our city's population.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient. Incorrect. Statement 2 is sufficient in both scenarios, but Statement 1 remains useful in assessing the adequacy of beds for larger populations.

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient. Correct. Whether Statement 1 or Statement 2 is considered, we can determine if our city has enough beds for patients.

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient. Incorrect. In this case, either statement alone is sufficient.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient. Incorrect. Both statements are indeed sufficient alone or in combination.

We can conclude that option (C) is the correct answer: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
Given answer: C

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
Let's analyze the sufficiency of each statement:

1. Student X got 7 questions correct.
To determine if this is sufficient, we need to know the total number of questions on the test. If there are 10 questions, then getting 7 correct would mean they got a 70% or higher and passed. However, if there are more than 10 questions, it's possible that 7 correct could be less than 70%. So while this statement might be enough, it's not guaranteed.

2. Student X got all the questions correct.
This statement is much more clear-cut than the first one. Regardless of how many questions there are, getting them all right means you have at least 70% (assuming there are at least 10 questions). Therefore, statement 2 alone is sufficient.

However, since we've found a sufficient answer in statement 2, we don't actually need to consider whether taking both statements together would provide even more information. But just for completeness:

If we consider both statements together, it doesn't give us any new information because statement 2 already confirms that Student X passed.

Conclusion:
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
Let's analyze each statement:

1. The area of circle B is two times the area of circle A.

If the area of circle B is twice that of circle A, it means that circle B has more space than circle A. However, this does not necessarily mean that circle B has a larger radius or is drawn on a larger scale than circle A. The areas of circles are directly proportional to the square of their radii (A=πr^2), so if circle B's area is 2A, its radius would be √2 times the radius of circle A. But since the square root of 2 is approximately 1.41, which is greater than 1, this statement implies that circle B does indeed have a larger radius than circle A, making it the larger circle. Therefore, statement 1 alone is sufficient to determine that circle A is smaller than circle B.

2. The radius of circle B is less than the radius of circle A.

If the radius of circle B is indeed less than the radius of circle A, then the size of circle B will definitely be smaller than circle A, regardless of their positions or orientations. Therefore, statement 2 alone is sufficient to determine that circle A is larger than circle B.

However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the wording of your question and the answer options, as both options A and B correctly indicate that a single statement is sufficient. To avoid confusion, I'll assume the question was meant to ask whether circle B is larger than circle A instead. In this case, statement 1 would suggest that circle B is larger, but statement 2 would correctly indicate that circle A is larger than circle B. As a result, neither statement alone is sufficient to definitively determine whether circle A is smaller than circle B, and the correct answer choice would be option (E): "Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient."

However, given the intended question of whether circle A is smaller than circle B, the correct answer would indeed be option (A) or (B), depending on the intended inequality between the circles' sizes.

(F). The question can be answered without either statement.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: F

Option 1 suggests that we can pour the water into another container to measure it accurately. This could be helpful in determining if the cup is more than half full or at least half empty. However, without statement 2, we have no way of measuring the total capacity of the cup, which is crucial to determining whether the cup is more than half full or at least half empty. Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Statement 2 suggests that we can use a ruler or measuring tape to measure the cup. While this may give us an idea of the cup's total capacity, it doesn't give us any information about the amount of water in the cup. Without this information, we can't determine if the cup is more than half full or at least half empty. Therefore, statement 2 alone is also insufficient.

However, when considered together, statements 1 and 2 become sufficient. By using a ruler or measuring tape, we can determine the total capacity of the cup. Then, by pouring the water into another container and measuring it, we can compare the amount of water to the total capacity. This will allow us to determine whether the cup is more than half full or at least half empty. Therefore, option (D) is correct - statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
1. Statement 1: Bill's gardening budget is $300 and he has spent some of the budget.

This statement is not sufficient because we don't know how much of the $300 budget Bill has already spent, nor do we know if the price of the pots are included in the budget spent. So we can't determine if Bill can afford to buy more $50 pots.

2. Statement 2: Bill has only spent his budget on 7 plants that cost $40 each.

This statement is sufficient. Since the previous information tells us that Bill's entire budget is $300 and he's only spent $280 on 7 plants. Therefore, Bill can still afford to buy more $50 pots as he has $20 left in his budget.

Since statement 2 is sufficient on its own, the correct answer is option (B).

Just for completeness' sake, let's consider the combined sufficiency of both statements. As noted, statement 2 is already sufficient on its own; therefore, even when taken together, the statements do not provide any additional useful information to answer the question. Hence, the answer remains the same - option (B).

Correct answer: C
1. Statement 1: "Justin's sister's father's son is Tim."

* Tim is being identified as the son of Justin's sister's father. This implies that Tim is the brother of Justin's sister, hence making him Justin's brother.
* Therefore, this statement is sufficient to conclude that Tim is Justin's brother.

2. Statement 2: "Justin is Tim's brother's father-in-law's only daughter's brother-in-law."

* This relationship involves many links and to find the direct relationship between Justin and Tim, we need to break it down:
	1. Tim's brother's wife (sister-in-law)
	2. Sister-in-law's mother (wife's mother)
	3. Wife's mother's husband (woman's husband or sister-in-law's father)
	4. Sister-in-law's father's son (man's child or Tim)
* So, statement 2 is indeed talking about Tim, as it moves from Tim's brother's wife all the way back to Tim.

By analyzing each statement, both can be used to establish that Tim is Justin's brother, however, statement 1 is simpler and more direct.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
Step 1: Analyze statement 1.
"x is divisible by the factors of 10." The factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10. If x is divisible by any of these factors, then x could be 2, 5, or 10, which are not prime numbers. However, x could also be a larger number divisible by 10, in which case it may still be prime. So statement 1 alone is not sufficient.

Step 2: Analyze statement 2.
"x is greater than 13." This statement tells us that x is not any of the smaller prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, or 13). But x could be a product of two prime numbers, in which case it would not be a prime number itself. For example, x could be 15 (which is 3*5) or 21 (which is 3*7). So statement 2 alone is not sufficient.

Step 3: Analyze both statements together.
If we combine both statements, we know that x is not a smaller prime number and that x is not divisible by any of the factors of 10 (except possibly 1, but we cannot assume that without further information). This means that x is unlikely to be a non-prime number. However, we do not have enough information to definitively say that x is a prime number.

Step 4: Conclusion.
The correct answer is (E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Correct answer: E
1. Half the people in the office don't read the newspaper.

This statement is not sufficient because it only gives us information about half of the people not reading the newspaper. We don't know the total number of people in Maria's office, so we cannot determine the exact number of people who do read the newspaper.

2. 10% of the people in Maria's office read the newspaper.

This statement is also not sufficient for the same reason as above. It tells us that 10% of the people read the newspaper, but we don't know the total number of people in the office, so we can't determine the actual number of people who read the newspaper.

Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Both statements are insufficient individually, as explained above.

Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

If we combine both pieces of information, we can find out the number of people who read the newspaper. For example, if we know that there are 20 people in the office, then according to statement 1, half of them (10 people) don't read the newspaper, which means that the other half (10 people) do read the newspaper. Similarly, according to statement 2, 10% of the people read the newspaper, which again amounts to 2 people in this hypothetical situation. However, the total number of people in the office is unknown, so we cannot use this information without statement 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

1. Komal is neither the tallest nor the shortest. This statement alone is not sufficient to determine who the third tallest person is because it doesn't give us any information about Rita, Rachel, and Kathy's heights in relation to each other. INSUFFICIENT.

2. Rita is only taller than Kathy and Komal. This statement alone is enough to determine that Rachel is the third tallest because if Rita is taller than Kathy and Komal then they are the two shortest. SUFFICIENT.

User 0: I agree with the explanation and conclusion.

Just to add, if we were to consider both statements together, we would still have insufficient information to determine the third tallest person. Knowing Komal's position (that she is neither the tallest nor the shortest) along with Rita being taller than Kathy and Komal isn't enough to definitively rank Rachel. Thus, even the combination of the two statements does not provide a clear answer, making option E incorrect.

Correct answer: A
1. Statement 1: x is an even number.
   If x is an even number, then it is divisible by 2. For example, x could be 2, 4, 6, etc., all of which are divisible by 2. So, statement 1 alone is sufficient to determine that x is divisible by 2.

2. Statement 2: The square root of x is greater than 4.
   The square root of x being greater than 4 means that x is greater than 16 (since 4^2 = 16). However, this doesn't necessarily mean that x is divisible by 2. For example, x could be 17, which isn't divisible by 2. Therefore, statement 2 alone is insufficient to determine if x is divisible by 2.

Let's evaluate the options:

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient. (This is correct based on our analysis above)
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient. (Incorrect, as we've determined that statement 1 is sufficient, and statement 2 is not)

Correct answer: C
1. Statement 1: Five years ago, Qi's age was half of her current age.

If we consider this statement alone, it means that Qi's age is double what it was 5 years ago. This kind of relationship between ages can be used to determine Qi's age if we know or assume something else. However, since we don't have any fixed value or range for Qi's age, we cannot definitively establish Qi's age based solely on Statement 1. Therefore, Statement 1 is insufficient.

2. Statement 2: Qi will be 23 years old in 5 years.

If we consider this statement alone, it directly gives us a piece of information about Qi's age in the future. By simple arithmetic calculation, we can deduce that Qi is currently 18 years old (23 - 5 = 18). Therefore, Statement 2 is sufficient to determine Qi's current age.

Given that Statement 2 is sufficient to determine Qi's current age, there is no need to consider the combined sufficiency of both statements.

Correct Option: (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: B
Success? False


<s>[INST]When is Tony's birthday? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Natasha correctly states that Tony's birthday is after 16th and before 19th March. 
2. Brenna incorrectly states that Tony's birthday is on 20th March.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E

Step 1: Analyze Statement 1.
Natasha correctly states that Tony's birthday is after 16th and before 19th March. This statement gives us a range for Tony's birthday between 17th and 18th of March. So, statement 1 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Step 2: Analyze Statement 2.
Brenna incorrectly states that Tony's birthday is on 20th March. This statement contradicts the information given in Statement 1, and since Natasha's statement is correct, we know that Statement 2 is incorrect. However, Statement 2 does not provide any new or helpful information to determine the exact date of Tony's birthday.

Step 3: Consider different combinations of statements.
- Using only Statement 1, we can determine that Tony's birthday is on either the 17th or the 18th of March.
- Using only Statement 2, we cannot determine the exact date of Tony's birthday, as Brenna's statement contradicts the information provided in Statement 1.
- Using both statements together, we still only have the information from Statement 1, as Statement 2 contradicts the accurate information obtained from Statement 1.

Step 4: Choose the correct option based on the analysis.
From our analysis, Statement 1 alone is sufficient to determine the answer, and Statement 2 is not required. Thus, the correct option is:

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient, while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: A
Success? False


<s>[INST]There are 50 cowsheds on a farm. How many cows live on the farm? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question? 
1. Each cowshed contains one cow. 
2. There are at least 60 cows.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
1. Each cowshed contains one cow: This statement means that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the number of cowsheds and the number of cows. Therefore, if this statement is true, we can determine that there is one cow in each cowshed, which means there are 50 cows. So, statement 1 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

2. There are at least 60 cows: This statement contradicts the information given in the question because it states that there are more cows than the number of cowsheds. This means that there cannot be one cow per cowshed, so some cowsheds must be empty or contain more than one cow. Hence, statement 2 alone is insufficient to answer the question.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A): Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: A
Success? True


<s>[INST]Saina Nehwal and P. V. Sindhu are to play a best-of-three-games badminton match. Which of the following outcomes is more likely? 
1. Saina loses the first game.
2. Saina loses the first game and wins the match.
Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Saina Nehwal has more physical stamina than P. V. Sindhu
2. P V Sindhu is ranked higher as a badminton player than Saina Nehwal.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (F) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(F). The question can be answered without either statement.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: F

Step 1: Analyze statement 1 - "Saina Nehwal has more physical stamina than P.V. Sindhu."
- This statement only refers to the players' physical stamina.
- However, badminton matches are not won solely based on physical stamina. They involve skill, strategy, mental toughness, and other factors.
- Even if Saina has more stamina, she could still lose the first game and then go on to win the match.
- Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient to determine the outcome of the match.

Step 2: Analyze statement 2 - "P.V. Sindhu is ranked higher as a badminton player than Saina Nehwal."
- Rankings indicate overall performance in various competitions, reflecting skills and achievements.
- However, rankings do not account for current form, motivation, or compatibility against specific opponents.
- For instance, Sindhu might be ranked higher but struggle against Saina, or Saina might have a specific strategy that works well against Sindhu.
- Therefore, statement 2 alone is also insufficient to determine the outcome of the match.

Step 3: Analyze combined statements.
- Neither statement alone is sufficient because neither addresses the main issue: the outcome of a badminton match.
- It's possible that Sindhu wins the first game due to superior ranking and skill, even if Saina has more stamina. It's also possible that Saina loses the first game but adapts her strategy to win the next two games.
- With both statements, we cannot definitively answer whether Saina losing the first game is more likely than her losing the match; the question requires speculating on the players' performance during a hypothetical match.

Step 4: Choose the correct option.
- Since neither statement alone is sufficient and the combined statements do not offer enough information for a definitive answer, option (C) cannot be correct.
- Given the analysis above, we cannot pick (A), (B), or (D); thus, (F) must be the right choice: "The question can be answered without either statement." Hence, no need to consider players' physical stamina or rankings when speculating about the outcome.
Given answer: F
Success? True

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
Let's consider the given statements one by one:

1. Some XYZs are ABCs: This statement doesn't provide any information about the relation between PQRs and XYZs. Thus, this statement alone is not sufficient to answer the question.
2. Some XYZs are PQRs: This statement tells us that there is an overlap between PQRs and XYZs. So, some PQRs are indeed XYZs, which is what we needed to know.

Now let's analyze the options:
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient: We've already determined that statement 1 isn't sufficient, so this can't be the correct answer.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient: This is the correct answer since statement 2 provides the necessary information to answer the question.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient: As we saw, statement 1 is not sufficient, so only having statement 2 would be enough.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient: Since statement 2 alone is sufficient, adding statement 1 doesn't contribute any new information to make it sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient: Since statement 2 alone is sufficient, this scenario isn't possible.

So, the correct answer is (B): Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Logic for statement 1: If the author of "Under the Sun" only writes adventure books, then it's very likely that Alina will want to read "Under the Sun" since she is looking for an adventure book.

Logic against statement 1: We don't have any information about Alina's preferences for authors, so we cannot be 100% sure that she will like the book just because it's an adventure book by a specific author.

Logic for statement 2: If Alina is only offered adventure and mystery books and "Under the Sun" is not a mystery book, then it can be inferred that "Under the Sun" is an adventure book. But we don't have any information about Alina's preferences for adventure books by this author or her preferences for the style of adventure books.

Logic against statement 2: We only know that "Under the Sun" is not a mystery book, but we don't know if Alina dislikes or likes other types of adventure books.

Conclusion: Since statement 1 gives us information about the author's genre, which increases the likelihood that Alina will read the book, while statement 2 only eliminates one possibility without providing any useful information on Alina's preferences regarding adventure books, statement 1 is more likely to be sufficient. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

Correct answer: A
Step 1: Analyze statement 1.
If Betty answered False, then we cannot determine the correct answer just from statement 1, because Betty's answer could be incorrect regardless of whether the correct answer is True or False. Statement 1 alone is not sufficient.

Step 2: Analyze statement 2.
Statement 2 tells us the number of questions on the test but not the content or the correct answers. Therefore, statement 2 alone is not sufficient.

Step 3: Analyze both statements together.
Even when considering both statements together, we do not have enough information to determine the correct answer. We only know that Betty answered a question incorrectly, but we do not know which question it was or what the correct answer should have been.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D

Let the marks obtained by S, T, U, and V be s, t, u, and v respectively.
We need to find the value of s-v.

Statement 1: The difference in the marks obtained by T and U is eleven. U got the highest marks.
This statement only gives us information about the marks of T and U. We don't have any information about S or V. So, we can't determine s-v from this statement alone.

Statement 2: The difference in the marks obtained by S and T is fifteen and the difference in the marks obtained by U and V is nine.
We can write this in equations as:
t - s = 15 ...(1) and
u - v = 9 ...(2)

But we don't have any information about t or u individually, so we can't find the value of s-v using this statement alone.

Combining both the statements, we have:
U > T, so u > t
From statement 1, we have, u - t = 11 ...(3)
From (1) and (3), we have, t - s = 15, u - t = 11, so u - s = 26
From (2), we have, u - v = 9, so v = u - 9
Now, s - v = s - (u - 9) = s - u + 9
But we don't have individual values for s or u to find their difference or add 9 to it.

Therefore, using either statement alone is not sufficient, and even combining both is not enough.
So the correct answer is (E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
Given answer: E
Success? False

[/INST]


Correct answer: B
Let's analyze the given statements:

1. E is sitting to the right of H.
This statement only defines the positions of E and H relative to each other but does not specify where G is sitting. We do not have any information about G or the other player F. Hence, statement 1 alone is insufficient.

2. F is sitting opposite to H.
This statement defines the position of F and H on the board, and it also indirectly provides information about G's position since opposite players are seated at diagonally opposite corners. If F is opposite H, then G and the remaining player must occupy the two remaining corners. Thus, statement 2 alone is sufficient.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient. Even if we combine both statements, we don't get any additional information, as statement 2 is sufficient by itself.

Note: While thinking through this problem, make sure not to assume extra information that isn't explicitly provided. It can lead to erroneous conclusions.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
To determine the relationship between Q and R, let's analyze each statement:

1. R is the niece of P:
This statement gives us information about R's relationship to P. However, it doesn't provide any direct link to Q. If Q is a brother, he could be related to P as a brother or a sibling of one of P's parents. But without more information, we cannot definitively establish the relationship between R and Q.

2. S has one sister R:
This statement provides information about R's relation to S but does not mention Q directly. However, it does give us another piece of the family puzzle.

Without knowing how S fits into the family tree with P and Q, we cannot definitively establish the relationship between Q and R based on either statement alone.

There are scenarios where both statements together could imply that Q and R are siblings since they share a common relation (S). But without knowing if S, P, or another person is the parent or sibling of both, we cannot conclusively say whether each statement is necessary or if either is sufficient alone.

Therefore, none of the options (A), (B), or (C) can be confirmed as correct, and we must consider (D) or (E).

Given the lack of clarity from both statements, we cannot say with certainty that both statements together are sufficient to establish the relationship between Q and R. Hence, the correct answer is option (E) - Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
Given answer: E
Success? False

Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
The total number of ants in the room cannot be determined with only the information that only black ants can be found indoors (Statement 1). The number of black ants in the room is still unknown. So, Statement 1 alone is insufficient.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
Statement 2 provides the number of red ants, which are not the only type of ants that can be found indoors (as per Statement 1). Hence, we do not have complete information about the total number of ants in the room. Therefore, Statement 2 alone is insufficient.

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
We have concluded that Statement 1 and Statement 2 alone are insufficient, so this option (C) is incorrect.

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
Since Statement 1 does not give the number of black ants and Statement 2 does not give the number of total ants or black ants, having both statements doesn't provide enough information to determine the total number of ants. Therefore, Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are insufficient.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
As we have determined that neither Statement 1 nor Statement 2 is sufficient individually and their combination isn't enough either, we can conclude that option (E) is the correct option.

So, the correct option is (E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
1. The hour hand is between 5 and 6.

If the hour hand is between 5 and 6, this means it could be anywhere from slightly past 5 to just before 6. We can't determine the exact time based on this information because we don't know how far past 5 the hour hand is. So statement 1 alone is insufficient.

2. The clock shows a quarter past five.

If the clock shows a quarter past five, we know that the time is exactly 5:15. This is specific enough to give us an exact time. So statement 2 alone is sufficient.

Since statement 2 is sufficient by itself, we don't need to consider taking both statements together.

So the correct answer is (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: B

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A

To determine the direction of P with respect to Q, let's analyze each statement:

1. Q is to the north of R, who is to the west of P.
This statement tells us that if we imagine a line connecting R and Q (with Q to the north), then P is somewhere on a line extending westward from R. The direction of P relative to Q could be any direction along this line, so this statement alone is not sufficient (we cannot definitively say whether P is towards the north, south, east, or west of Q).

2. P is to the north-west of S.
This statement gives us information about the location of P but does not provide any information about the location of Q. Thus, this statement alone is not sufficient to determine the direction of P relative to Q.

However, when both statements are considered together:
1. Q is to the north of R, who is to the west of P.
2. P is to the north-west of S.

We know that P is to the north-west of S, which creates a reference point for P's location. Since Q is to the north of R and R is to the west of P, then Q must be to the east of P's location (because Q cannot be both to the north and west/south/directly above or below P due to that straight-line relationship). So, when both statements are taken together, the direction of P relative to Q can be determined as towards the south, since Q is to the east of P.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
Given answer: D
Success? False

Correct answer: D

Option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

(against) Statement 1 doesn't explain the relationship between A and B directly. It only tells us about B's brothers but doesn't tell us who A is in relation to B.

Option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

(for) Statement 2 tells us that A's father is the brother of Arav's mother, implying that Arav is A's cousin. This means A and B are cousins as well, since they share a common set of parents who are siblings.

Option C: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

(against) Statement 1 isn't sufficient on its own.

(for) Statement 2 is sufficient, as explained in option B.

Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

(against) With both statements, we now know that B has two brothers (statement 1), one of whom is Arav (statement 2), and that Arav is A's cousin (statement 2 again). However, this redundantly confirms A and B's cousin relationship without directly explaining their exact relationship.

Option E: Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

(against) Statement 2 alone is actually sufficient.

Conclusion:
The correct option is option (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Correct answer: E

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

If buses usually depart on time, this does not necessarily tell us the actual departure time for the airport bus today. Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

The scheduled arrival time doesn't give us information about the departure time of the bus. So statement 2 alone is insufficient.

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

Since neither statement is sufficient alone, this option is incorrect.

Together, these statements also do not give enough information to determine the departure time of the airport bus today. Statement 1 only tells us buses usually depart on time, and statement 2 gives us the arrival time, not departure.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

We've established that neither statement 1 nor 2 alone provides enough information. As explained in option D, even taken together, the statements don't provide enough information to determine the departure time. So, option E is the correct answer: neither statement nor both statements taken together are sufficient.

The right option is (E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
Given answer: E
Success? True


<s>[INST]Is Ajay the only son of Aparna? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Aparna's brother has only one nephew.
2. Ruhi is Ajay’s sister.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
Step 1: Analyze Statement 1: "Aparna's brother has only one nephew." This statement gives us information about the number of children that Aparna's brother has, but it does not directly tell us if Ajay is her only son. If Aparna has other children apart from Ajay, then those children could be her brother's children as well. But the statement says that there is only one nephew, which means that none of Aparna's other children (if any) are her brother's kids. However, we cannot conclude from this that Ajay is Aparna's only son. Hence, statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Step 2: Analyze Statement 2: "Ruhi is Ajay’s sister." This statement directly tells us that Ajay is a male child of Aparna. But it doesn't provide any information about whether or not Aparna has any other children. So, we cannot conclude from this statement alone that Ajay is Aparna's only son. Hence, statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Step 3: Analyze together: When we consider both statements together, we still cannot definitively answer the question. Statement 1 tells us about the number of nephews and statement 2 tells us about one of Aparna's children, but neither statement confirms that Ajay is Aparna's only son.

Step 4: Conclusion: Therefore, the correct answer is (E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
Given answer: E
Success? False


<s>[INST]How many students are sitting in a row facing the board? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Kavya, who is fifth from the left end, is ninth to the left of Aadesh who is seventh from the right end.
2. Jagrav is eighth to the right of Neerja, who is sixteenth from the right end and fifth from the left end.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
1. From statement 1, we know that Kavya is fifth from the left end and ninth to the left of Aadesh. This means that there are 4 students between Kavya and Aadesh (since Kavya is to the left of Aadesh). But we can't determine the total number of students sitting in a row just from this statement. Hence, statement 1 alone is not sufficient.

2. From statement 2, we know that Jagrav is eighth to the right of Neerja, who is sixteenth from the right end and fifth from the left end. So, there are 15 students to the right of Neerja and including Jagrav, which makes it 16 students. Also, Neerja is the fifth from the left end, so there are 4 students to the left of Neerja. Therefore, there are a total of 16 + 4 = 20 students in the row. Hence, statement 2 alone is sufficient.

Correct Option: (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: B
Success? False


<s>[INST]In a game, words for colours are mixed up. What is the colour of a fresh tomato in this game? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. In the game, blue is called green, white is called black, brown is called purple.
2. In the game, yellow is called white, red is called orange and green is called brown.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
1. Statement 1: This statement does not mention the color of red, which fresh tomatoes are most commonly associated with. Therefore, this statement alone is insufficient to determine the color of a fresh tomato in the game.

2. Statement 2: This statement mentions that red is called orange in the game. Fresh tomatoes are often red, but if red is called orange in the game, that means a fresh tomato would be called orange as well. Therefore, statement 2 alone is sufficient to determine the color of a fresh tomato in the game.

Since statement 2 is sufficient on its own to answer the question, the correct answer is (B): Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

There is no need to consider statement 1 and statement 2 taken together, because statement 2 is already sufficient.

It's important to note that the wording of statement 1 may have been designed to trick us into thinking that colored words are being mixed up randomly, but the key here is to find the word that indicates the color red and understand how it is referred to in the game context.
Given answer: B
Success? True


<s>[INST]Kubera, the wealthy king of the Yakshas, liked all things made of gold and silver. The king decided to gift every Yaksha family a spherical globe made of solid gold with a cylindrical silver rod passing through its center. His goldsmith told him that this would require a 6 cm long, perfectly cylindrical hole to be bored through each perfectly spherical golden globe in order to insert the silver piece. Only the gold surrounding the curved surface of the silver cylinder would be retained. Kubera wanted the silver rod to be inserted but he was worried that gold was going to have to be removed from each of the globes. The goldsmith assured him that there would still be a fair bit of gold still left after the drilling.
What was the remaining volume of the golden globe, after drilling, when it was ready to be inserted with the silver rod?
Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Each silver rod was perfectly aligned perfectly with the vertical axis of the globe.
2. The diameter of the silver rod was exactly 1.25 cm.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (F) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(F). The question can be answered without either statement.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: F
Here's how we can analyze this problem:

The volume of the gold remaining after drilling is dependent on the inner diameter of the gold sphere, which is determined by the diameter of the silver rod. If we know the diameter of the silver rod, we can calculate the inner diameter of the gold sphere and thereby its volume.

1. Each silver rod was perfectly aligned perfectly with the vertical axis of the globe.
This statement doesn't provide any new information that helps us determine the inner diameter of the gold sphere. We already know that the silver rod is passing through the center of the sphere, so it doesn't matter whether it's aligned with the vertical axis or not - the inner diameter will still be determined by the diameter of the rod.

2. The diameter of the silver rod was exactly 1.25 cm.
This statement gives us the crucial piece of information we need to calculate the inner diameter of the gold sphere. Once we have this, we can find out the volume of the remaining gold.

From the above, it's clear that only Statement 2 is sufficient to answer the question. Statement 1 is not necessary and does not provide any additional information relevant to solving the problem. Therefore, the correct option is:

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: B
Success? False

2. The book has 380 pages out of which three-fifths were read by Wednesday.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Logic for Statement 1: This statement tells us that the last 54 pages were read on Friday. So, the pages read on Thursday would be the total number of pages minus those read on Friday. Therefore, statement 1 alone is sufficient to answer the question.

Logic against Statement 1: There's no logic against it because we have enough information to find out the answer without needing statement 2.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Logic for Statement 2: According to this statement, three-fifths of the 380-page textbook were read by Wednesday. Three-fifths of 380 equals 228, so we know that 228 pages were read by Wednesday. However, this doesn't tell us anything about the pages read on Thursday, so statement 2 alone is insufficient to answer the question.

Logic against Statement 2: As mentioned above, we don't have enough information to determine the number of pages read on Thursday.

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

This is not the correct option because neither statement provides enough information on its own to determine the number of pages read on Thursday.

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

As explained above, statement 1 provides enough information to determine the answer, so there's no need to consider statement 2 as well.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Since statement 1 is actually sufficient on its own, this option cannot be the correct one.

So, the correct answer is (A): Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: A
Success? False

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
Let's analyze each statement:

1. Karan said that he had one sister.
This statement implies that Karan has only one sister, but it does not directly specify whether Jhanvi is his sister or not. So, this statement alone is not sufficient to determine the relationship between Karan and Jhanvi (Option A is incorrect).

2. Jhanvi said that she had one brother.
Similarly, this statement implies that Jhanvi has only one brother, but it does not directly specify whether Karan is her brother or not. So, this statement alone is also not sufficient to determine the relationship between Karan and Jhanvi (Option B is incorrect).

Now let's consider both statements together:

Together, these statements suggest that each of them has only one sibling. By combining the information from both statements, we can confidently say that Karan is Jhanvi's brother, and Jhanvi is Karan's sister (Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient).

Therefore, neither Statement 1 nor Statement 2 is sufficient alone, but combining both statements provides enough information to determine their relationship as siblings (Option D).
Given answer: D
Success? False

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: C
1. Each girl has twice as many sisters as brothers. This statement gives us information about the ratio of sisters to brothers, but it does not actually provide any concrete number of girls or boys. Therefore, it is not sufficient to determine the number of girls in the family.
2. The youngest child is a boy and he has 3 sisters. This statement tells us that there are 4 children in total, and that one of them is a boy, leaving us with 3 girls in the family. Therefore, this statement is sufficient to answer the question.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) - Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

<s>[INST]At the finals of the All India Logic competition, the announcer displays six words:  MOSS, DRAG, CULT, CHOP, TRIM, GUTS. Each of the 4 finalists, representing the 4 regional champions within India (North, South, East & West), is given an envelope. Each of those 4 envelopes bear one distinct letter from one of those six words. All those distinct letters in the three envelopes are chosen from the same word. The contestants are forbidden from disclosing the letter in their envelope to anybody else. Each contestant has to determine the chosen word from the list of six.
The announcer asks the Eastern contestant, Durga, whether she can deduce the word. She instantly replies, “Yes!” Without asking her to identify the word, the announcer now moves to the regional champion from the North, Lakshmi and asks her whether she can identify the word. She thinks for a few seconds and then breaks into a smile, “Yes, I know the word.”
What is the word?
Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1.After Lakshmi, the announcer now looks at the contestant from the West and asks, “Saraswati , what about you?” Within moments, she too breaks into a smile and nods, “I know the word!”
2. The last person to answer is Meenakshi. She says, “Now I also know the word.”

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
1. Statement 1 alone:

The fact that Durga, the Eastern contestant, was able to deduce the word means that the letter in her envelope must be sufficient to determine the word. This is because the words on the list are short and unique, and the letters are distinct. By looking at her envelope, Durga can eliminate two words (those that do not contain her letter) and choose from the remaining four. If Lakshmi is also able to identify the word with the additional information given to her, then statement 1 is sufficient.

Final answer: Statement 1 alone is sufficient.

2. Statement 2 alone:

Meenakshi's response doesn't add any new information. Saraswati's smile suggests that the word can be deduced based on Durga's and Lakshmi's information, which is in line with the reasoning for statement 1. Since Meenakshi's response does not change the conclusion, statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Final answer: Statement 2 alone is insufficient.

3. Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together:

As we have already concluded that statement 1 is sufficient and statement 2 does not add any new information, there is no need to consider the two statements together.

Final answer: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are not necessary.

So, the correct answer is option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient, while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: A
Success? False

[/INST]


Correct answer: F
Step 1: Let's analyze the given statements and options.

Statement 1: Vighnesh likes computer programming.
Statement 2: Vighnesh likes playing video games.

Option A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
Option B: Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
Option C: Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
Option F: The question can be answered without either statement.

Step 2: Let's evaluate each option.

For Option A:
- Statement 1 being true (Vighnesh likes computer programming) indicates that he might like programming because it can be part of his interest in technology or problem-solving.
- However, just because he likes computer programming, it doesn't mean he likes playing video games as well (option 2 is still unknown). Therefore, statement 1 alone is not sufficient.

For Option B:
- Statement 2 (Vighnesh likes playing video games) doesn't necessarily mean he likes computer programming. While there is a connection between the two, one doesn't automatically imply the other. Statement 2 alone cannot be considered sufficient.

For Option C:
- Statements 1 and 2 are not mutually exclusive; someone can like both computer programming and playing video games.
- However, neither statement alone provides enough information to definitively answer the question.

For Option D:
- This option suggests that both statements are necessary for answering the question.
- As mentioned in Options A and B, neither of them alone provides enough information. But, if Vighnesh likes both computer programming and video games, it is possible that he has a wider interest in technology-related activities.

For Option F:
- The question cannot be answered without any statements as it forms the basis for making any conclusions.

Step 3: Based on our evaluation, the correct answer is Option D: Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
Given answer: D
Success? False

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
Step 1: Analyze statement 1.
Statement 1: A is not lighter than C.
This statement does not give any information about the weight of B or its comparison with A. Hence, it is insufficient to determine if A is heavier than B.

Step 2: Analyze statement 2.
Statement 2: D weighs the same as A and B is heavier than D.
This statement tells us that B is heavier than D and D has the same weight as A. Since we know that B is heavier than A, this statement is sufficient to determine that A is not heavier than B.

Step 3: Analyze combinations of statements.
(A) Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient. This option can be eliminated because statement 2 alone is actually sufficient.
(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient. This is the correct option, as shown in step 2.
(C) Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient. This option can be eliminated because statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient. This option can be eliminated because statement 2 alone is sufficient.
(E) Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient. This option can be eliminated because statement 2 alone is sufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
Step 1: Analyze statement 1.
Statement 1 gives us the information that 'apo fu qe nane' means 'mango leaf is long' and 'nane ko' means 'long stick'. From this, we can infer that 'nane' could possibly mean 'leaf' since it is referred to as long stick in one of the phrases. However, we cannot be completely sure because it could also mean 'stick' as in 'long stick'.

Step 2: Analyze statement 2.
Statement 2 gives us the information that 'apo qe lans' means 'green mango leaf' and 'ka lans' means 'green book'. From this, we can infer that 'lans' means 'green' and 'apo qe' means 'mango'. But there is no direct relation established between 'nane' and 'leaf'.

Step 3: Evaluate if either statement is enough for a definite answer.
Statement 1 is not enough because 'nane' could also mean 'stick'. Statement 2 is not enough because it doesn't provide a direct relation between 'nane' and 'leaf'.

Step 4: Evaluate if both statements together are enough for a definite answer.
Even when we consider both statements, we don't have any additional information to confirm that 'nane' means 'leaf'. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that 'nane' means 'leaf'.

Step 5: Choose the correct option.
The correct answer is (E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Final answer: The correct option is (E).

Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
1. Statement 1: Jayant's birthday is on an even date of the month.

If Jayant's birthday is on an even date, then it could be the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 20th, 22nd, 24th, 26th, or 30th. However, without more specific information, we cannot determine which exact even date in December 2012 Jayant was born on.

Logic for statement 1 being insufficient: Statement 1 gives us a range of potential dates but not a specific date, so we cannot determine Jayant's exact birthdate based on this statement alone.

2. Statement 2: The day of the month on which Jayant was born is a prime number.

Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that can only be divided by 1 and themselves. In the case of days in December 2012, only three days fit this description: the 3rd, 5th, and 31st. However, we still do not have enough information to pinpoint Jayant's exact birthdate.

Logic for statement 2 being insufficient: Like statement 1, statement 2 provides a range of potential birthdates but not the exact one, making it insufficient on its own.

3. Considering both statements together:

By combining both statements, we know that Jayant was born on an even date (statement 1) that is also a prime number (statement 2). In December 2012, only one date meets both criteria: the 23rd (which is not a prime number).

Since no day in December 2012 fits both conditions, we cannot definitively determine Jayant's birthdate based on the given statements.

[/INST]


Correct answer: A
1. In half an hour, seven-twelfths of the tank is filled: This gives us information about the rate at which the pump fills the tank, since it tells us that the pump can fill seven-twelfths of the tank in 30 minutes. With this information, we can calculate how long it will take to fill the entire tank (by dividing the total volume of the tank by the rate of pumping), so statement 1 is sufficient on its own.

2. The pump is switched on at 9:00 a.m.: This statement doesn't provide any information about the rate at which the tank fills up or the size of the tank. It only tells us when the pump was turned on. Therefore, statement 2 is not sufficient to answer the question.

Based on this analysis, the correct option is A: Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Step 1: Let's consider statement 1 alone: "The CEO spoke 30 words per minute." This gives us the speaker's rate of speech, but it doesn't give us the total number of words spoken or the duration of the speech. Without knowing the total number of words, we can't determine how long the speech was. Therefore, statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Step 2: Now let's consider statement 2 alone: "Had the CEO spoken 5 fewer words per minute, her speech would have lasted 4 more minutes." This gives us a relationship between the CEO's speaking rate and the length of the speech. We can rearrange this statement to solve for the original duration: if the CEO had spoken 5 fewer words per minute, she would have spoken (30 - 5 = 25) words per minute for 4 minutes longer, so the original speech duration was (30 * 4 = 120) minutes shorter than it would have been at the slower rate. However, we still don't know the original speaking rate or the total number of words, so statement 2 alone is also insufficient.

Step 3: If we combine both statements, we have enough information to find the answer. 

From statement 1, we know the speaking rate is 30 words per minute.
From statement 2, if the speaking rate were 5 words per minute slower, the duration would be 120 minutes longer. Given that the speaking rate in statement 2 is 5 words per minute less than in statement 1 (i.e., 25 words per minute), we can infer that the duration of the speech is also 120 minutes. 

However, since we were able to find the answer by combining both statements, neither statement alone is sufficient, and the correct answer is:
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
Given answer: D
Success? True

Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
1. Statement 1: "X's father has 3 children."
This statement does not specifically mention Devi, so it's possible that Devi could be one of the three children, and she could have 0, 1, or 2 daughters. But without more information about X's gender or the genders of Devi's possible daughters, this statement is not enough to determine how many daughters Devi has. Insufficient.

2. Statement 2: "Y is X's sister and daughter of Devi."
This statement tells us that Devi is Y's mother. However, it doesn't tell us anything about X, or whether X is a daughter of Devi or not. So again, while we know that Devi has at least one daughter (Y), we can't be sure if Devi has any other daughters. Insufficient.

3. Considering both statements:
From statement 1, we know there are 3 children, and from statement 2, we know Y is one of them. But this still doesn't exclude the possibility that Devi has only one child (Y) or more than one child (Y and another one who isn't mentioned).

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

<s>[INST]Among 5 friends - Anjali, Arun, Ritika, Vishwesh and Kartik, who is the tallest? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. Anjali is taller than Arun and Kartik.
2. Arun is shorter than Ritika but taller than Vishwesh.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E

Step 1: Let's analyze each statement for sufficiency.

Statement 1: Anjali is taller than Arun and Kartik.
This statement gives us information about Anjali's height relative to Arun and Kartik only. We do not have any information about her height relative to Ritika or Vishwesh. Therefore, statement 1 alone is NOT sufficient.

Statement 2: Arun is shorter than Ritika but taller than Vishwesh.
This statement tells us about Arun's height relative to Ritika and Vishwesh, but it does not provide us with any information about Anjali, Kartik, or Ritika's heights relative to each other. Thus, statement 2 alone is NOT sufficient.

Step 2: Now let's consider the two statements together.

With both statements, we know that Anjali is taller than at least two people (Arun and Kartik), and Ritika is taller than Arun, who in turn is taller than Vishwesh. However, we still don't know whether Anjali is taller than Ritika, so we cannot definitively say who the tallest person is. Thus, even when taken together, the statements are NOT sufficient.

Step 3: Conclusion
The correct answer is option (E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient. This question cannot be answered based on the given information.
Given answer: E
Success? True


<s>[INST]How is X related to Y? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. X's father is married to Z.
2. Y is the daughter of Z, who has a son and daughter.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
Step 1: Let's analyze statement 1 first. It states that X's father is married to Z. This does not directly give us any information about the relationship between X and Y. Even if X's father is married to Z, it doesn't necessarily mean that Y is related to X, since Z could have children from previous relationships or marriages. Therefore, statement 1 alone is not sufficient.

Step 2: Now let's analyze statement 2. It states that Y is the daughter of Z, who has a son and daughter. While this tells us that Y is related to Z, it still doesn't provide a direct connection to X. However, it does tell us that Z has at least one son, which means that Y could potentially be a sister to X if X is also one of Z's children. But without further information, we cannot confirm this. Therefore, statement 2 alone is also not sufficient.

Step 3: If we consider both statements together, we now know that X's father is married to Z and that Y is one of Z's children. With this combined information, we can deduce that X and Y could be siblings if X is also one of Z's children. Since Z has at least one son (from statement 2), and X's father is married to Z (from statement 1), it's possible that X is the son in this family, making X and Y sibling.

However, even with both statements, there is still a missing link: we don't know whether X is actually one of Z's children. The given statements do not explicitly state this fact. Hence, neither statement alone is sufficient, and even with both statements, we cannot definitively conclude that X is related to Y as a sibling.

Therefore, option (E) "Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient" is the correct answer.
Given answer: E

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D

Statement 1: A plays hockey.
This statement only tells us that A does not play cricket, football, or chess. It doesn't tell us anything about the other three people. So this statement is NOT sufficient. We cannot determine who plays cricket based on statement 1 alone.

Statement 2: C plays neither chess nor football.
This statement tells us that C plays either cricket or hockey. However, it doesn't tell us anything about the choices of A, B, or D. So, this statement is NOT sufficient to determine who plays cricket.

Taking both statements together also doesn't give us enough information to definitively say who plays cricket. We know C plays either cricket or hockey, but we don't know the choice of A, B, or D.

Therefore, neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor both taken together are sufficient to determine who plays cricket. The correct answer is option E.
Given answer: E

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: B
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

The first statement, "The clock shows 7:45 a.m.," doesn't provide enough information for us to determine how much a clock loses in a day. This statement only gives the current time, so it isn't helpful for answering our question.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Statement 2 tells us that the hour and minute hands of the clock coincide every 63 minutes starting at noon. With this information, we can calculate the loss of time per day. In a standard clock, the minute hand moves ahead of the hour hand by 5 minutes every hour. For the hands to coincide again after 12:00, the minute hand will have to move ahead by an extra 3 minutes (63 - 60 = 3). Therefore, the minute hand moves faster than normal, which means the clock loses 3 minutes every cycle of 12 hours. To find the total loss per day, we need to multiply this value by 2 (since it happens twice in a day), giving us 6 minutes lost per day. So, statement 2 is sufficient to answer the question.

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

As determined previously, statement 1 is insufficient to answer our question. Thus, this option can be eliminated.

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Statement 2 can answer our question independently, so combining it with statement 1 doesn't make it any more sufficient. 

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

We have already determined that statement 2 is sufficient, so this option can be eliminated. 

Conclusion:

Since only statement 2 is enough to answer the question, the correct answer is (B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: B

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Logic for this statement being sufficient: If there is one tabla instructor for each of the 52 classes held in this city, then we can determine the number of tabla instructors just by knowing the number of classes.

Logic against this statement being sufficient: Statement 1 only gives us information about the number of tabla instructors, but it doesn't tell us if they are all actively teaching or if some have multiple classes.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Logic for this statement being sufficient: If each tabla instructor teaches 5 students, then we can potentially find out how many instructors there are by dividing the total number of students by 5 (assuming each student has a unique instructor).

Logic against this statement being sufficient: Statement 2 doesn't provide any information about the total number of classes or tabla instructors; therefore, we cannot be sure that the instructors don't teach at more than one class or location.

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

This option can be eliminated because neither statement provides complete information to answer the question without considering the other statement.

Statement 1 only gives us information about the number of classes but not about the distribution of instructors. Statement 2 tells us about the instructor-student ratio but not about the total number of instructors or classes.

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Logic for this statement being sufficient: If we have information about both the number of classes and the instructor-student ratio, we can potentially cross-check and confirm the number of tabla instructors in the city.

For example, if we know that there are 52 classes and that each instructor teaches 5 students, then even if some instructors teach at multiple classes, we can infer that at least 10 instructors are needed for the minimum number of students. With this information, we could potentially verify if there are other instructors teaching the remaining classes. Therefore, both statements taken together provide enough information to answer the question.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

This option can be eliminated based on the logic provided in option (D).

Therefore, the correct option is (D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
Given answer: D

1. 50.9% of all babies born in a given year are male while 49.1% are female.
2. The nearby hospital has a small maternity ward while the one far away has a much larger maternity ward.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D

Step 1: Analyze statement 1.

(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.

Logic for: The ratio of male to female births is roughly 1.05:1, meaning there will be a slightly higher number of male births than female births in any given situation, including at both hospitals. Therefore, if we know nothing else but this about the hospitals, we can conclude that the nearby hospital will have more male births than female births.

Logic against: However, statement 1 does not provide any information about the distribution of births between the two hospitals. As such, it doesn't account for potential discrepancies in the number of male vs. female births at the nearby vs. faraway hospital, or the hospitals' sizes.

Step 2: Analyze statement 2.

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Logic for: Statement 2 does not provide any information about the distribution of male and female births, so it doesn't allow us to conclude which hospital will have more male births than female births.

Logic against: Statement 2 does provide information about the relative sizes of the maternity wards in the two hospitals. This information could matter if there were factors specific to the larger hospital that influenced the gender distribution of births (for example, if the larger hospital had access to more advanced medical technology that made it more likely for parents to carry a pregnancy to term).

Step 3: Analyze combined statements.

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Logic: Given that statement 1 does not provide any information about the distribution of births between the two hospitals, and statement 2 does not provide any information about the gender distribution, neither statement is sufficient on its own to answer the question.

However, taking the two statements together still doesn't give us enough information to conclude which hospital will have more male births than female births. Even if we know the overall ratio of male to female births (statement 1) and the relative sizes of the hospitals' maternity wards (statement 2), we do not have information about the gender distribution specific to each hospital.

Step 4: Choose the correct answer.

Since neither statement 1 nor statement 2 provides enough information on its own to answer the question, and combined they still do not provide enough information, the correct answer is:

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
Given answer: E
Success? False

What is the correct option? Think step by step.
Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: E
To determine if A is B's brother, let's analyze the given statements:

Statement 1: C is B's spouse.
This statement only gives us information about C's relationship with B. We do not have any information about how A is related to B or C. Thus, statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Statement 2: A is C's relative.
This statement tells us about the relationship between A and C, but it doesn't provide any information about B. However, if A were the brother of C, then statement 1 would provide the necessary information to confirm that A is indeed B's brother (since C is married to B). But without statement 1, we cannot conclude that A is B's brother based on statement 2 alone.

Now let's consider both statements together:

If C is B's spouse (statement 1) and A is a relative of C (statement 2), then it's possible that A is B's brother. However, we cannot definitively conclude this without more information. For example, A could be C's sibling, cousin, parent, or any other type of relative.

Thus, neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor both together are sufficient to answer the question. Therefore, the correct option is:

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Success? True

Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: A
1. Statement 1: In total, 2343 single-person tickets were bought.

This statement only tells us the total number of tickets sold, it does not account for any possible capacity limits of the stadium. It's possible that the stadium could hold more than 2343 people, or less, so we cannot definitively say how many fans went to the stadium based solely on this information.

Insufficient.

2. Statement 2: The stadium can seat 2600 fans.

This statement gives us a capacity limit for the stadium but does not tell us if this capacity was reached or exceeded. The stadium could have been only half-full, for all we know. So, similar to statement 1, we cannot definitively say how many fans went to the stadium based solely on this information.

Insufficient.

3. Analyzing both statements together:

With both statements, we know the total number of tickets sold (2343) and the maximum seating capacity of the stadium (2600). However, even with this combined information, we don't know whether all the tickets were used, fewer than 2600 people showed up, or if some people had multi-person tickets (which are not ruled out by the wording of statement 1).

Neither statement alone is sufficient, and together they are still not enough to definitively answer the question because there might be cases where the number of tickets sold is less than the capacity but more than the actual number of fans who attended due to multi-person tickets or no-shows.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.
Given answer: E

Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D
1. Statement 1: M is not younger than P and O is older than N.
From this statement, we only know that O is older than N, but we don't have enough information about M and P's ages. For example, M could be older than both O and P, in which case there would be no friends older than O. Or it could be that M and P are both older than O. So, statement 1 alone is insufficient.

2. Statement 2: P is older than exactly two friends.
This statement tells us that P is older than both M and N, but it doesn't tell us where O fits in. If O is older than M and N, then there would be no friends older than O. But if M or N (or both) are older than O, then there are friends older than O. Since statement 2 doesn't specify, it too is insufficient.

However, when we consider both statements together, we see that since P is older than exactly two friends (and not three), then P must be older than M and N, but not O. Combined with the information from statement 1 that O is older than N, this means that there is only one friend who is older than O - M. Therefore, option (D) - Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient, is the correct answer.

Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.
Conclude with which option is the correct one.
[/INST]


Correct answer: D

First, let's analyze Statement 1: "Neither S nor T pairs with either Q or R." This statement tells us that Q and R are not paired with S or T, but we already know that P is not paired with Q or R. So, this statement doesn't provide any new information about the pairs involving P. Therefore, Statement 1 alone is insufficient. Option (A) is incorrect.

Now, let's analyze Statement 2: "Neither P nor Q pairs with either S or U." This statement eliminates the possibility of P being paired with S or U (and also eliminates Q being paired with S or U, but we already knew that from the question stem). Since we know that P is not paired with Q or R, and Statement 2 eliminates P being paired with S or U, by process of elimination, the only remaining possibility is that P must pair with T. Additionally, Q and R cannot pair with S or T, so they must pair with each other.

So, Statement 2 alone is sufficient. The pairs are: PT, QR, and SU.

Therefore, option (B) is correct: Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: B
