Correct answer: B
Here's how to approach this problem using Z3:

```smt
(declare-sort Person)
(declare-const cole Person)
(declare-constheight_cole Real)
(declare-const min_team_height Real (> min_team_height 6))
(declare-const max_height Real (< max_height 7))

; Statement 1: Cole is under 7 feet tall
(assert (>= height_cole max_height))

; Statement 2: Every player on Cole's varsity basketball team is above 6'1"
(assert (â‰¥ min_team_height 6.1))

; Question: Is Cole over 6 feet tall?
(query (or (< height_cole 6) (= height_cole 6)))
(check-sat) ;; OUT
```

We first declare constants for Cole's height, the minimum height of players on the team, and a constant just under 7 feet. We then assert Statement 1 and Statement 2. Lastly, we ask Z3 if Cole is under or equal to 6 feet tall, which is the negation of "Cole is over 6 feet tall".

By running the above code, you'll see that Z3 returns 'unsat' as the answer. This means there is no solution where Cole is under or equal to 6 feet tall while satisfying both statements. Thus, Cole is over 6 feet tall. The correct option for the question would then be:

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

Here's the reasoning:

(A) Statement 1 is not sufficient alone, as Cole could still be 6 foot 2 inches tall, making him over 6 feet tall. This can be represented in Z3 as follows:

```smt
(assert (= height_cole 6.2))
(query (or (< height_cole 6) (= height_cole 6)))
(check-sat) ;; OUT
```

Z3 returns 'sat', meaning Cole could indeed be under or equal to 6 feet tall, which contradicts our conclusion based on the combination of both statements.

(B) Statement 2 alone is sufficient, since it indicates all players on the team are over 6 feet 1 inch. If Cole is part of the team, he must also be over 6 feet 1 inch tall. Additionally, Statement 2 does not bring any upper limit, unlike Statement 1. Z3 confirms our initial conclusion when we remove Statement 1 and ask a similar question using the code below:

```smt
(query (< height_cole 6))
(check-sat) ;; OUT
```

Z3 returns 'unsat', meaning Cole cannot be under 6 feet tall based solely on Statement 2. Thus, option B is the one that correctly answers the question.

Correct answer: B

The question asks how many students are in the classroom, but neither of the statements provide enough information to determine the total number of students. The statements only provide information about the number of students who failed and the rank of one student.

Here is an analysis of each statement:

1. Five students failed.
	* This statement does not give enough information to determine the total number of students. There could be any number of students, and five of them could have failed.
	
```smt
(declare-fun num_students () Int)
(declare-fun num_failed () Int)
(assert (= num_failed 5))
(check-sat) ;; OUT: unsat
```

2. One student was 29th from the top and 16th from the bottom.
	* This statement also does not give enough information to determine the total number of students. The only information we have is the position of one student in relation to the rest of the class.
	
```smt
(declare-fun top_position () Int)
(declare-fun bottom_position () Int)
(assert (and (= top_position 29) (= bottom_position 16)))
(check-sat) ;; OUT: unsat
```

Since neither statement provides enough information to determine the number of students in the classroom, the correct answer is:

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

```smt
(declare-fun num_students () Int)
(declare-fun num_failed () Int)

Correct answer: E
Here's how you can approach this problem:

First, let's define our variables and assumptions in Python:

```python
from z3 import *

# Define direction variables
N, S, E, W = Ints('N S E W')

# Define direction mapping
dir_map = {N: "North", S: "South", E: "East", W: "West"}

# Constrain Samuel's direction to not be North
samuel_not_north = N != 1

# Define sun's direction as S
sun = S
```

With this setup, we can test if statement 1 alone is sufficient to determine Samuel's direction.

```smt
# Check if statement 1 is sufficient
s = Solver()
s.add(samuel_not_north)
print(s.check())  # OUT: unsat
print(s.model())  # OUT: no solution, which means statement 1 is not sufficient alone
```

Now, let's see if statement 2 alone is sufficient to determine Samuel's direction.

```smt
# Check if statement 2 is sufficient
s = Solver()
s.add(sun == S)
print(s.check())  # OUT: unsat
print(s.model())  # OUT: no solution, which means statement 2 is not sufficient alone
```

However, we can combine both statements to find out if they provide enough information together.

```smt
# Check if statement 1 and statement 2 are sufficient together
s = Solver()
s.add(samuel_not_north, sun == S)
print(s.check())  # OUT: unsat
print(s.model())  # OUT: no solution, which means statement 1 and 2 are not sufficient together
```

So the correct answer is:

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

For each reasoning step, check your reasoning with Z3. Model your reasoning in a code block starting with "```smt". Finish the code block with `(check-sat) ;; OUT` where OUT indicates whether the output should be `sat` or `unsat`.[/INST]


Correct answer: B
First, let's consider statement 1: "There are no red balls in the basket." This statement does not give us any information about the color of the balls in the basket, so it's possible that there are only blue balls, but it's also possible that there are balls of other colors. Therefore, statement 1 alone is not sufficient to answer the question.

Next, let's consider statement 2: "The smallest ball in the basket is green." This statement tells us that there is at least one green ball in the basket, and it is the smallest one. However, it does not tell us anything about the other balls in the basket. In particular, it does not tell us whether there are any blue balls in the basket. Therefore, statement 2 alone is not sufficient to answer the question.

Now, let's consider both statements together. Even with both statements, we still do not have enough information to determine whether there are only blue balls in the basket. Statement 1 tells us that there are no red balls, but we already knew that from statement 2 (since green balls are smaller than any hypothetical red balls). Statement 2 tells us that there is at least one green ball and it is the smallest, but again, we already knew that from statement 2. Therefore, neither statement 1 nor statement 2 provides any additional information when considered together.

Hence, the correct answer is (E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

We can use Z3 to model the problem and verify our reasoning:

```smt
(declare-sort Ball)
(declare-fun redBall? (Ball) Bool)
(declare-fun blueBall? (Ball) Bool)
(declare-fun greenBall? (Ball) Bool)

; Statement 1: There are no red balls in the basket.
(assert (forall ((b Ball)) (not (redBall? b))))

; Statement 2: The smallest ball in the basket is green.
(assert (forall ((b Ball)) (=> (greenBall? b) (not (smaller? b)))))

; Question: Are there only blue balls in the basket?
(check-sat) ;; OUT: unsat
```

In the above code, we declare a sort `Ball` to represent the balls in the basket, and three predicates `redBall?`, `blueBall?`, and `greenBall?` to represent the colors of the balls. We then assert statement 1 and statement 2 as conditions on the predicates. Finally, we check whether the following statement is true:

"There are no balls that are not blue."

If this statement is true, then the answer to the question is yes, there are only blue balls in the basket. However, the code returns `unsat`, indicating that the statement is not true in general. Therefore, the answer to the question must be no, there are not only blue balls in the basket.
Given answer: E

Correct answer: A

Here's how we can reason through this problem using Z3:

We'll define two predicates, `hatesVeggies` and `likesCarrots`, to represent the statements. We'll assign them as free variables and check if any assignment of these variables to `True` or `False` would satisfy the conditions given in the problem.

```smt
(declare-fun hatesVeggies () Bool)
(declare-fun likesCarrots () Bool)

; Statement 1: Leonid hates vegetables.
(assert (or (not hatesVeggies) (not (lovesCarrots))))

; Statement 2: Leonid prefers carrots to leeks.
(assert (lovesCarrots))

(check-sat) ;; OUT: sat
(get-model) ;; OUT: 
; Model: hatesVeggies -> false
;          lovesCarrots -> true
```

From the model, we can see that Statement 2 is sufficient to determine that Leonid likes carrots, since `lovesCarrots` is assigned to `True`. We can also see that Statement 1 is not necessary, as the SMT solver was able to find a satisfying assignment without setting `hatesVeggies` to `True`.

Now that we have determined that Statement 2 is sufficient, we can omit Statement 1 from our consideration.

```smt
(declare-fun likesCarrots () Bool)

; Statement 2: Leonid prefers carrots to leeks.
(assert (lovesCarrots))

(check-sat) ;; OUT: sat
(get-model) ;; OUT: 
; Model: lovesCarrots -> true
```

As we already determined, the SMT solver finds that Statement 2 alone is sufficient to determine that Leonid likes carrots.

Therefore, the correct option is:

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
Given answer: B
Success? False

Correct answer: E
Here's how we can reason through this:

1. The probability of event B occurring is what we want to find out.
2. Statement 1: Probability of event A is 0.55. This doesn't directly give us information about event B.
3. Statement 2: Probability of either A or B or both A and B happening is 0.65. This tells us about the union of A and B, but it doesn't give us the individual probabilities of A and B.
4. However, if we know both the probability of event A and the union of events A and B, we can find the probability of event B. This is because P(A âˆª B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A âˆ© B), so we can rearrange to find P(B) if we know P(A) and P(A âˆª B).

Therefore, neither statement 1 nor statement 2 alone is sufficient, but together they are. The correct answer is (D).

In Z3, we can model this as follows:

```smt
(declare-fun P(Bool) Real)
(declare-const A B Bool)
(assert (or A B))
(assert (= P(or A B) 0.65))
(assert (= P(A) 0.55))
(check-sat) ;; should be unsat
(assert (not (= P(or A B) 0.65)))
(check-sat) ;; should be sat
(assert (not (= P(A) 0.55)))
(check-sat) ;; should be sat
(assert (not (and (= P(or A B) 0.65) (= P(A) 0.55))))
(check-sat) ;; should be sat
```

In the first `check-sat`, we're asserting that there exist values for A and B such that P(A) = 0.55 and P(A âˆª B) = 0.65, but this is unsatisfiable because these values do not uniquely determine P(B).

In the second `check-sat`, we relax the constraint on P(A), allowing it to take on any value, and indeed find that there are many combinations of A and B that satisfy the constraint P(A âˆª B) = 0.65.

In the third `check-sat`, we relax the constraint on P(A âˆª B), allowing it to take on any value, and indeed find that there are many combinations of A and B that satisfy the constraint P(A) = 0.55.

In the final `check-sat`, we assert that both P(A) = 0.55 and P(A âˆª B) = 0.65, and check whether this is satisfiable. Indeed, it is, and we can find many combinations of A and B that satisfy both constraints and therefore allow us to uniquely determine P(B).

Correct answer: D
Step 1: Analyze the first statement - "All buildings with more than 20 floors need a special license."
This statement is about a condition for needing a special license, but it doesn't directly tell us whether the building contractor needs a special license. We would need more information about the specific situation of the building contractor and the building they want to build.

```smt
(declare-fun has_special_license () Bool)
(declare-fun num_floors () Int)
(assert (=> (> num_floors 20) has_special_license))
(check-sat) ;; UNKNOWN - we don't have any information about the building contractor's situation
```

Step 2: Analyze the second statement - "The building contractor wants to build a 30-storey building."
This statement tells us about the building contractor's plans, but it doesn't provide any information about whether a special license is needed for building a 30-storey building.

```smt
(declare-fun has_special_license () Bool)
(declare-fun num_floors () Int)
(assert (= num_floors 30))
(check-sat) ;; UNKNOWN - we don't have any information about the requirement of a special license
```

Step 3: Analyze the combined information from both statements
With both statements, we now have enough information to determine whether the building contractor needs a special license. The first statement provides the condition for needing a special license, and the second statement tells us that the building will have 30 floors. Therefore, we can determine whether a special license is needed.

```smt
(declare-fun has_special_license () Bool)
(declare-fun num_floors () Int)
(assert (=> (> num_floors 20) has_special_license))
(assert (= num_floors 30))
(check-sat) ;; SAT - we now have enough information to determine the requirement of a special license
(get-value (has_special_license)) ;; should return 'true'
```

Based on the analysis above, the correct answer is:
(D) Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

Even though neither statement alone is sufficient, the two statements together provide enough information to determine whether a special license is required.
Given answer: D

Correct answer: C
First, let's analyze statement 1. It tells us that if 5 brick-laying machines work with 5 men, the wall will be built in 7.5 hours. We know that 10 men can build the wall in 6 hours, so the total man-hours required to build the wall is 10 * 6 = 60 man-hours.

If 5 machines and 5 men can do the job in 7.5 hours, then the combined man-machine-hours required is 5 * 5 + 5 * 7.5 = 25 + 37.5 = 62.5 man-machine-hours.

This gives us conflicting information about the total work required to build the wall, so statement 1 is not sufficient.

Now, let's consider statement 2. It states that the brick-laying machines work twice as fast as the men. Therefore, if 10 men can complete the job in 6 hours, then 10 * 2 = 20 machine-hours are needed to complete the job. Since 5 machines working together would take 6 * (1/5) = 1.2 times longer, the time it would take for the machines to complete the job alone is 20 * 1.2 = 24 machine-hours.

We can express this information as a proportion to solve for the time it takes 5 brick-laying machines to build the wall: 
Wall_hours = (5 / (5 + 10)) \* (6 * (5 / (5 + 10)))
Wall_hours = (5 / 15) \* 1.2 * 6
Wall_hours = 2 \* 1.2 * 6
Wall_hours = 14.4 hours

Since we were able to use statement 2 alone to find an answer for the time it takes the 5 brick-laying machines to build the wall, statement 2 is sufficient.

Therefore, the correct option is (B).

Here is the SMT-lib code that demonstrates the logic used in statements 1 and 2.
```
(set-logic QF_NRA)
(set-info :smt-lib-version 2.0)

(define-fun man-hours () Real 60)

(declare-fun wall-machines () Real)
(declare-fun machine-hours () Real)
(assert (= (* wall-machines 5) machine-hours))

(define-fun machine-time () Real (/ machine-hours (* 10 wall-machines)))
(define-fun man-time () Real (/ man-hours (* 10 wall-machines)))

(assert (or (> machine-time man-time) (< machine-time man-time)))

(define-fun st1-machine-time () Real (/ (* 5 (+ (* 5 machine-time) (* 5 man-time))) (* (+ 5 wall-machines) (* 10 wall-machines))))
(define-fun st1-wall-time () Real (/ (* 15 st1-machine-time) (* 5 wall-machines)))

(assert (not (= st1-machine-time st1-wall-time)))

(define-fun st2-machine-time () Real (* 1.2 man-time))

(assert (= man-time (/ wall-time (* 10 wall-machines))))
(assert (= machine-time (/ machine-hours (* 10 wall-machines))))

(define-fun st2-wall-time () Real (* wall-machines (/ (* 1.2 man-hours) (* 10 wall-machines))))

(push)
(assert (not (= st2-machine-time st2-wall-time)))
(check-sat) ;; OUT: unsat
(pop)

(check-sat) ;; OUT: unsat
```
This SMT-lib code tests the logical consistency of statements 1 and 2 against the given problem facts. Statement 1 is logically inconsistent because it contradicts the information contained in the problem, whereas statement 2 is logically consistent with the problem. Therefore, statement 2 is sufficient to find the solution.
