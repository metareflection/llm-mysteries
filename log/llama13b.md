Hint: There is a detail that is not relevant to the story but is a red herring. Look for it.
The detail that is not relevant to the story but is a red herring is the fact that Leona is described as "eighty years old and almost deaf." This is not relevant to the story because it does not help to identify the murderer, and it is only included as a way to make Leona seem more unpleasant. Therefore, it is a red herring.
Based on the information provided, it seems likely that the murderer is Alice. Here's why:

1. Alice poured the tea, and Ruth said that one of them laced it with arsenic.
2. Alice is the only one who has spoken so far, and she said that she poured the tea along with hers. This suggests that she may have had a hand in lacing the tea.
3. Alice

## 5minutemystery-the-missing-son

I'm happy to help you solve the mystery! Here are my thoughts, step by step:
1. Amanda's youngest son, Kyle, is the one who did not make it to first hour.
2. Amanda suspects that Kyle is the culprit because he has been experiencing attention span problems and is not doing well in school.
3. Kyle might have skipped class to avoid a pop quiz or to get away from his report card.
4. Amanda knows that Kyle is the "problem" child and has been having difficulty getting along with his report card.
5. Therefore, it is likely that Kyle is the one who skipped class.

Is that correct? Do you have any other clues or information that might help us solve the mystery?

I'd be happy to help you solve the mystery! Based on the information you provided, here's my reasoning:

2. Leslie surveyed the kitchen and didn't notice anything out of the ordinary, except for the missing cupcake. This suggests that the culprit may have been in the kitchen and had access to the cupcakes.
3. Leslie observed the kids in the playroom and didn't see any obvious signs that one of them had eaten the cupcake, such as chocolate fingers or dirty mouths. This suggests that the culprit may have hidden the cupcake, rather than eating it in front of Les

This is a classic whodunit mystery, and I'm happy to help you solve it! Here's my analysis of the case:
1. Kevin King: Kevin is a suspect because he was in the room when the murder happened. He also had a motive, as his father had taught him martial arts and guns, and he was undisciplined. However, his uneasiness on the phone and his claim that he was in the bathroom when the murder happened make him seem less likely to be the killer.
2. Dianne Shelby: Dianne is a suspect because she had a motive - she was in bad terms with her husband due to her frequent infidelity. She also admitted that she saw him with some woman earlier that night, which could have led to a confrontation. However, she was shot in the back, which suggests that the killer may have been standing behind her.
