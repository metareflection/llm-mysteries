Correct answer: B
====ABOUT TO QUERY LLM===
R:  
### Answer & Explanation

No. of blue balls = b ; No. of green balls = g ; No. of red balls = r
Statement 1 : g = 0 passing only
Statement 2 : No. of smallest value balls < 2
Two possibilities:
Case 1 : No. of green balls = 1
- No. of blue balls = b & No. of red balls = r

Case 2: No. of green balls = 2 ; r = 0
Mean ball value = g2/2 + g1 /3 + b / 5 = 6 /3 + 6/5 = 4 ; remains = 3
Maximum value possible = 3
Hence, either b = 1 & r = 2 --> g = 0 or b = r = 0 --> g = 2
Now, consider whether blue balls are only in basket or not. No. of blue ball = 1, 2 , 3 will satisfy small statement 1 and 2 together.
Hence, D is the correct option.
From the statement 1 we can infer that there are no red balls.
Then statement (2) suffices as there could be only blue and green balls which we cannot be identified if its not known from how many balls do we beginf
So after the addition of second statement, the total no of balls becomes 10+5=15 but we need confirmation by statement 1 that there cannot be any red balls it is the basket. hello

Say, Leonid likes both carrots and leeks.
Statement 1 alone: Leonid hates vegetables = He does not like either of the carrots and/or leeks => Not sufficient

Statement 2 alone: Leonid prefers carrots to leeks => Not sufficient

Taking both 1 & 2 together: Leonid hates vegetables = He does not like either of the carrots and/or leeks. Also, Leonid prefers carrots to leeks.
Now, notice that both the statements could satisfy the condition that Leonid likes only carrots and not leeks. But they can also satisfy the condition that Leonid may hate both carrots and leeks.
So, both the statements together are also Not Sufficient.

Option E

P.S. Leonid does not necessarily hate vegetables as is evident from the original case. But the options require us to analyze that scenario.

Both of them are insufficient because you can't be sure he prefers carrot and leeks and hate celeris. He can just not like celeris and yet like all the other two.

Say, Leonid likes toads for breakfast and has 8 toads. Notice that statement 1 has nothing to say about the opinion of the frogs for similies. It becomes non
sufficient if we assert that Leonid thinks that frogs are tasty animals...

Statement 2 only implies the same thing. Not sufficient.

Both taken together :

Let's pretend that statement 1 implies that Leonid thinks that toads are tasty, then statement 2 only means that the opinion of Leonid on the perfect breakfast is the toads, whatever the impression that the toads have on Leonid. Which only implies, by consequence, that Leonid hates toads. Nothing else.

Correct answer: D
====ABOUT TO QUERY LLM===
R:  
- Statement 2 alone is sufficient.
- Statement 1 alone is definitely not sufficient. There is no number of floors mentioned.
- Those combined are asking for conditions of a special license. While getting a project built, those conditions are taken into account and hence it means what ever it takes to get a project built, is sufficient for the main Street and therefore statement 2 is surely true [+1]
- Statement 1 alone is sufficient.
- Statement 2 alone is definitely not sufficient. The number of floors can not be recovered from the strength of 'More than'. It can also mean 21,31,1000000 floors buildings.
- Combined and Type B statement should lead to contradiction. On the one side, it can lead to conclusion (which will be agreed by both statement 1 and statement 2) that, height is not more than 20. On the other side, 30 floors are enough to make it more than 20 and statement 2 becomes contradicting.
- Obtaining A construction license depends on the height and not height. that is by itself is fine too.

Will the building contractor need a special license?

[ST1]All buildings with more than 20 floors need a special license. The building contractor wants to build a 30-storey building.

[ST2]The building contractor needs a special license.

[RM]

My answer:

My understanding of the question was: Is the Special License a compulsory requirement for building contractors to build buildings of height more than 20 floors?

A.Both statements are sufficient alone to answer the question (Either alone can answer the question YES or NO).
B.Both statements together are insufficient (situations can be found, where both the statements can be 'YES' and 'NO' simultaneously ).
C.One statement alone is insufficient to answer the question (both may be true in given scenarios).
There is some error in statement A or B or C, Hence answer is not (A),(B)
Statement B talks about a special license.
Statement A cannot be true for all the time.
There can be various loopholes in the question that provide me with the answer as C. I am not seeing any all the time.
Therefore answer is D
ADITINoment
I have written everything on the basis of statements.
Do you have the answer? If yes,which of the following is the correct option?

Is there any scenario, where you are not accepting any of the statements and saying E?

Can you rule out two statements?
Came across 2 Statements

[A] All buildings with more than 20 floors need a special license.
[B] The building contractor wants to build a 60 storey building.

Statement 1 true, says he wants to build a 30-storey therefore certainly needs a special license.
Statement 2 true, says he has no plans of building a 30-storey

Both true states needs a special license.

A.Both statements are sufficient alone (all time) to answer the question.
B.Both statements together are definitely not sufficient.
C.One statement alone is definitely not sufficient.
Either way is a possibility.

Confusion with Statement 2's wording. Now it is a NEED or WANTS or some other type.
Can 'Wants' imply 'Need' in this context?

Statement 2 says he wants to build. Then the Municipal Administration generally permits you the license after clearing & getting your project implemented. Probably the contractor gets the license as usually done. But statement 1 is taken as all buildings in future have to posses a license and he can't submit an NOC if a license is pending for his construction

Certainly Option D.

Sup? Any contradiction noted?

From Statement 1 alone,

he might never get the 30 storey building license, the govt remove it from the list of the number of floors to be get a special licence

From Statement 2 alone,

he might never get a 60 storey licence, the govt remove it from the list of the number of floors to be get a special licence

From Statemetn 1 & Statement 2,

he might never get a freaking special licence for any amount of storey, as this niche doesn't exist anymore and govt have removed it as a result you CANNOT build a 30 or 60 storey without having the corresponding licence now

So enough for him to not need any licence?

Not! Can have 5 storey structure and get it NOOB.

As a procedural decision of the municipal administration has made a change in policy, it can hold good for a period.
Only when unforeseen circumstances occur.
There is no change in the policy of requiring a licence for 21 floor or more, as considered by you. There is a change in the existing policy [statement A] You can post this in other thread on GMAT clarification (forum)

A change in the policy means, awarding of 20 storey building won't have a license to take permit in the future. Building should have a license only when it has more than 20 floors.

Is it true for all the time?

Statement 1: It could be true for a day, and tomorrow it changes.
Statement 2: Could say the same about 60 storey.

No option works, as there would be no regulation in all buildings always.
should the scheme apply to all buildings? And how do we know that? There are 2 possibilities "item" does have a license "item" does not have a license. There is a change of policy & it applies to all buildings. There could be buildings that don't fall under these regulations.

This is purely procedural and based on administrative sanctions. It can be "freed" by higher authorities from the time the building is under construction to stop "unsanctioned" use of the facility in even before it is nearing completion. If it is outside the city it c

Is there any construction that requires a license for 20 and above floors and is there a construction without a license? No. It is simply that you cannot get a license for 30-floor construction. There is something in the procedure that removes this procedure.

I don't understand how it is understood that a building license is required for 21 floors and more.

I understand the building contractor wants to build a building, not applying for a license, another statement that it must be built when applying for a license. This is for buildings of 20 floors and more.

Therefore statement 2 is false.

As a matter of fact you can take it as

lets analyse 1st statement.

2nd statement says: contractor wants to build 30 p [why not?] - its 2 wrong answers to "2" questions , there no question of firm even and then Outcome is NO i.e contractor does NOT NEED to apply for license even..

There is some error in statement A or B or C, Hence answer is not (A),(B)
Statement B talks about a special license.
Statement A cannot be true for all the time.
There can be various loopholes in the question that provide me with the answer as C. I am not seeing any all the time.
Therefore answer is D
ADITINoment
I have written everything on the basis of statements.
Do you have the answer? If yes,which of the following is the correct option?

Is there any scenario, where you are not accepting any of the statements and saying E?

Can you rule out two statements?
Came across 2 Statements

[A] All buildings with more than 20 floors need a special license.
[B] The building contractor wants to build a 60 storey building.

Statement 1 true, says he wants to build a 30-storey therefore certainly needs a special license.
Statement 2 true, says he has no plans of building a 30-storey

Both true states needs a special license.

A.Both statements are sufficient alone (all time) to answer the question.
B.Both statements together are definitely not sufficient.
C.One statement alone is definitely not sufficient.
Either way is a possibility.

Confusion with Statement 2's wording. Now it is a NEED or WANTS or some other type.
Can 'Wants' imply 'Need' in this context?

Statement 2 says he wants to build. Then the Municipal Administration generally permits you the license after clearing & getting your project implemented. Probably the contractor gets the license as usually done. But statement 1 is taken as all buildings in future have to posses a license and he can't submit an NOC if a license is pending for his construction

Certainly Option D.

Sup? Any contradiction noted?

From Statement 1 alone,

he might never get the 30 storey building license, the govt remove it from the list of the number of floors to be get a special licence

From Statement 2 alone,

he might never get a 60 storey licence, the govt remove it from the list of the number of floors to be get a special licence

From Statemetn 1 & Statement 2,

he might never get a freaking special licence for any amount of storey, as this niche doesn't exist anymore and govt have removed it as a result you CANNOT build a 30 or 60 storey without having the corresponding licence now

So enough for him to not need any licence?

Not! Can have 5 storey structure and get it NOOB.
 Please refer to my ans while it will take:: Statements A and B are individually insufficient to arrive the answer ~~~~ hi Jun and Rybakon :)

As a procedural decision of the municipal administration has made a change in policy, it can hold good for a period.
Only when unforeseen circumstances occur.
There is no change in the policy of requiring a licence for 21 floor or more, as considered by you. There is a change in the existing policy [statement A] You can post this in other thread on GMAT clarification (forum)

A change in the policy means, awarding of 20 storey building won't have a license to take permit in the future. Building should have a license only when it has more than 20 floors.

Homophones: Wants – Need – Wish

- Wants is a desire to have or do something. “The definition of wants is of a kind of need that does not rise to the level of obligatory need or essential want but is one of desirability or appeal”
- Need is the condition of having to have or do something (versus wanting) if you need something, it has become a necessity for you.
- Need does not consist of wanting or desiring something
- Wish is an expression of hope, something that happens in the future

Is it really a building license we are discussing here?

Can't decide? Create a New Discussion Thread here.

Is it true for all the time?

Statement 1: It could be true for a day, and tomorrow it changes.
Statement 2: Could say the same about 60 storey.

No option works, as there would be no regulation in all buildings always.
should the scheme apply to all buildings? And how do we know that? There are 2 possibilities "item" does have a license "item" does not have a license. There is a change of policy & it applies to all buildings. There could be buildings that don't fall under these regulations.

This is purely procedural and based on administrative sanctions. It can be "freed" by higher authorities from the time the building is under construction to stop "unsanctioned" use of the facility in even before it is nearing completion. If it is outside the city it c

Is there any construction that requires a license for 20 and above floors and is there a construction without a license? No. It is simply that you cannot get a license for 30-floor construction. There is something in the procedure that removes this procedure.

I don't understand how it is understood that a building license is required for 21 floors and more.

I understand the building contractor wants to build a building, not applying for a license, another statement that it must be built when applying for a license. This is for buildings of 20 floors and more.

Therefore statement 2 is false.

As a matter of fact you can take it as

To do business you should have license or permit no matter how much you earn. [here earn Wealth in Crores]

To do constructions also you'll need a permit permit given by genuine bureaucrats. It means all construction plus nearby landscape plants which shouldn't be fragmented for long period is at least permitted through proper application procedures in due formality permission periodically may late around 15 years old (not even much to worry in long run) parametres shall be issued or immediately terminated if any one of them changes they move upto closing their brick-and-mortars activities off floating prefabricated post top : look exotic over CO2 Flavoidicted Upland

HELLO
in my judgement the correct ans whould be "A".
lets analyse 1st statement.
1st statement says.no building has license with more than 20p [why not?]
2nd statement says: contractor wants to build 30 p [why not?] - its 2 wrong answers to "2" questions , there no question of firm even and then Outcome is NO i.e contractor does NOT NEED to apply for license even..

====ABOUT TO QUERY LLM===
R:  The correct answer is B ((B))

(A) Yes, we can conclude that there will be a higher chance of crocodile attacks on humans next year, if there has been more crocodile attacks on humans, that is, if statement 1 is true.
However, we don’t know if this increase chance will result in more crocodile attacks. It may in fact, go down again.
The reason why more attacks on humans were recorded this year need not be the same reasons for more attacks in the previous year. For example, a crocodile may have just recently moved into the area to hunt for humans.

( B ) Yes, we can conclude that there will be more crocodile attacks on humans next year, if we know that 56 people were attacked by crocodiles this year.
Recalling our logic behind why statement 1 is insufficient to say whether there will be more crocodile attacks next year, we see that there are many reasons why the number of attacks on humans may go down next time.
So, again, to avoid falling into the trap of: “If this year, there was a large number of attacks this year, there will be a large number the following year”, we can’t say that there will be less crocodile attacks next year. It’s just a high possibility based on past habits and behaviour of crocodiles in that region.

Although both ( A ) and ( B ) statements taken by themselves are not good enough to reach this conclusion either, both of them together can help us to conclude that there will be more attacks in the future.

Step-by-step equation:
56 = a Crocodiles attacked humans this year.

Two Crocodiles attacked 1 human each this year.
X Crocodiles attacked Y humans each this year.
X + 56 = Y
X = Y + 56

We can gather many more catastrophic attacks on machines and/or software committing “Simple check” actions. It would be nice to read about that kind of accidents too.

Correct answer: E
====ABOUT TO QUERY LLM===
R:  
[spoiler=]According to the first option if, 50% of the people in the office do not read the newspaper then it is not necessary that 10% of the people in the office read the newspaper

If 50% of the people do not read the newspaper (100 – 50 = 50)
And if 10% of the people read the newspaper (100 – 50) - 10% = 90 people read the newspaper. (20*100)/10

According to this logic it, it can be concluded that 90 people read the newspaper, that is not correct.90 is neither equal to 50 nor to 0, can be 49 or to 99, so for one option only the option can not be considered sufficient

In the second option it is given that 10% of the people read the newspaper. If 10% of the people are reading then

(100 – 50)*10/100 => 40/100 = 40% people in the office read the newspaper

So if 40 people read the newspaper and 90 people do not read the newspaper, then we can conclude that 0 people read the newspaper

Here, since the two statements are contradicting it's impossible to assume that a part in the office reads the newspaper. So, for second option we can't say conclude anything about the option either as sufficient or insufficient[/spoiler]

Correct answer: C
====ABOUT TO QUERY LLM===
R:  This type of question seems very common for new members especially for mock tests. People get stuck at this part. This must-to-know technique will help them a lot.
For the question above the given statements are not sufficient on instant viewing. By applying the technique WHAT CONFERENCES CAN HAPPEN IF WE TAKE EITHER STATEMENT TOGETHER IT FOLLOWS THAT ONE OF THEM IS ALWAYS ENOUGH.
1. Statement 1 - means : Qi is 5 times the age yesterday. (ratio of ages)
So in 5 years, it becomes 10 times the age. (ratio of ages)
So, Qi's age is 15 years tomorrow (ratio of ages is squared).
Now we can quickly eliminate C never true.
Take D to see it matches the info given in 2 > Conclusions : This means Qi is 5 years today.
So, Qi must be 30 years (not true)(ruling out E), That means after 5 years Qi will be 35.
Since 35 is not equal to 23 then we can rule out D.
2. Statement 2 is not sufficient as we do not know Qi's age now.
Thus, 2 alone is insufficient.
2 together with 1 then we can logically find the age as
Qi's age = 15.
She will be 25 years after 5 years.
23 then, Qi's age is currently 20.
Therefore, correct answers is B.

NOT HOW TO USE LOGIC DIFFICULTY:
*Information theory: Information is a measure of disorder.
=> If there is more disorder/uncertainty, the more entropy is there.
=> Who brings order/structure/information/certainty is a intelligence.
=> So, nature produces entropy and evolution tries to reduce this with a force called information thesis.
=> So, information is about increased order and intelligence is what brings order.
INFO: Information is about increasing or enlarging our perception and adding of information by its processing.
In previous problems, probably both your and other sources of information come in.

Impossible possibilism:
Idea: PM says "The character in a story changed as a storyteller".
    Information cannot be outside of us, it is within us, but the context can be outside/within us.
    In this case, what changed is the contract. So, what changed is the information/knowledge in the internal mind. * - What is a choice warrants a change to the premises. In this invalid 'null' situation, the given is not about a new situation, but about a change to the knowledge already there.

Action/reaction:
Idea: The problem is how X is solved for us? Omit X. Then, what is the result? If all things become y, then what is the result? Objective analysis will show X ?
Lack: A definition does not have the definition or a property of the definition. If y and z are the definitions, then we need to assume they are capable of defining the other one and other vice-versa and y does not include z and z does not include y.
Shortcut:  If y is the definition of z,
     then we need all properties of z in y. Unknown

Interference with physical direction:
Idea: Who or what maintains physicality in nature? The question needs physical answer.
'Add' concept: place all those objects in the mouth that do not go in the hand, in the hand.
*The given demands explanation to them. The only way to argument is to increase difficulty and warp. If that is not done, the first people to solve the problem can find the answer but for you/me it may may not be possible.

Hook and eye: This is an idea to enable the capture/understanding of those who look at us for something we want and which may be outside the box. Just give them the steps to start operating.

Mind map:
Idea: Generate/create some visual or physical model of everything in all forms. Then, stand and stare at the commonality of this group. The mind maps will be present only where the solution is present. ...
[lock and key]
[necessary but not sufficient condition]
[sufficient but not necessary condition]

required tool(s): The correct formed conclusion
discovered tool: Coherence between different statements of the question.
General answer.
Narrow it to do it. From available, find the necessary alignments. But tools about focus.
If logic/intuition are needed to really solve the problem then the solution should be intuitive/non-intuitive. OR, there should be more things but we can only use the number of words/signs.
But if you can create your way, make it, and prove or disprove it with all steps and best possible alternatives.

Operation:
Idea: We first estimate our level. On one of them, since we have coming back option or next to level . We go ahead of the problem and come back to the abyss along a different route. Now that problem can be solved at two different levels. You also pass the different solution [educate] by showing that there is another way and another new way. Now, the old way is not useful. So, without estimate and next to next to the old way, we can logically proceed. The question now has two questions. But, we can deal with only one question at a time.

Statistical concept:

We can estimate the measure of our chance of being correct/buying the 'several available' where.

[1]. This book is a mystery/adventure book. [AU]
[2]. If this book is a mystery/adventure book, then Alina wants to read this book. [AI]

-> MIND SET: [Make a list of things you are sure about when they are true. This is a thing you can use to plan a new truth. This is already established facts. This is your ABSOLUTE TRUTHS.]

[p] Alina wants to read an adventure book. (given)

[q] Alina reads Under the Sun. (unknown)

L1). The author of "Under the Sun" only writes adventure books.
Then, Under the Sun will be an adventure book.
Then, May Alina would want to read Under the Sun.
Then, Q is possible. So, let Q be yes.
------------------------------
L2). Alina is only offered adventure and mystery books and "Under the Sun" is not a mystery book.
If Q is possible, $1 \equiv mystery, 0 \equiv not mystery$.
Action) $1$ is either present or not. [This is a given. No more hypotheses are needed]
hypothesis) $1$ is absent.
=> $\lnot 1$ //denied hypothesis

Then, "Under the Sun" is not a mystery.
=> Q will be possible.
So, Q is possible. Let Q be yes.
------------------------------
ERROR). There is no logical flow in the above analysis.
Ans) B: So, in different cases Q can be concluded to be true, in each case Q will be possible. (B) is correct.

[BEWARE]
Premise:
*Logical truth: What is stated in the premises to be true.
Postulate: Something that our explanation cannot prove. So, it is assumed to be true.
Assumption: Something a person believes in it without a sufficient proof or proof. This is a predicted thing. This can be accepted or proved later
------------------------------------------------------------------
Idea: Obviously, remembering the previous series will help you select a clearer option. (Look at:

TYPELESS: Problem description will be asterisk. Then, question only with its answer options, but without any tag is a TYPELESS problem.
INTELLIGENT: Problem description will be asterisk. Then, question only with its answer options with info/hints is an INTELLIGENT problem.

Every TYPILESS problem can be solved like an INTELLIGENT problem. But, not every INTELLIGENT problem can be solved as a TYPILESS problem./
--------------------
NOT HOW TO USE LOGIC DIFFICULTY:
*Information theory: Information is a measure of disorder.
=> If there is more disorder/uncertainty, the more entropy is there.
=> Who brings order/structure/information/certainty is a intelligence.
=> So, nature produces entropy and evolution tries to reduce this with a force called information thesis.
=> So, information is about increased order and intelligence is what brings order.
INFO: Information is about increasing or enlarging our perception and adding of information by its processing.
In previous problems, probably both your and other sources of information come in.

Impossible possibilism:
Idea: PM says "The character in a story changed as a storyteller".
    Information cannot be outside of us, it is within us, but the context can be outside/within us.
    In this case, what changed is the contract. So, what changed is the information/knowledge in the internal mind. * - What is a choice warrants a change to the premises. In this invalid 'null' situation, the given is not about a new situation, but about a change to the knowledge already there.

Action/reaction:
Idea: The problem is how X is solved for us? Omit X. Then, what is the result? If all things become y, then what is the result? Objective analysis will show X ?
Lack: A definition does not have the definition or a property of the definition. If y and z are the definitions, then we need to assume they are capable of defining the other one and other vice-versa and y does not include z and z does not include y.
Shortcut:  If y is the definition of z,
     then we need all properties of z in y. Unknown

Interference with physical direction:
Idea: Who or what maintains physicality in nature? The question needs physical answer.
'Add' concept: place all those objects in the mouth that do not go in the hand, in the hand.
*The given demands explanation to them. The only way to argument is to increase difficulty and warp. If that is not done, the first people to solve the problem can find the answer but for you/me it may may not be possible.

Hook and eye: This is an idea to enable the capture/understanding of those who look at us for something we want and which may be outside the box. Just give them the steps to start operating.

Mind map:
Idea: Generate/create some visual or physical model of everything in all forms. Then, stand and stare at the commonality of this group. The mind maps will be present only where the solution is present. ...

[necessary but not sufficient condition]
[sufficient but not necessary condition]

required tool(s): The correct formed conclusion
discovered tool: Coherence between different statements of the question.
General answer.
Narrow it to do it. From available, find the necessary alignments. But tools about focus.
If logic/intuition are needed to really solve the problem then the solution should be intuitive/non-intuitive. OR, there should be more things but we can only use the number of words/signs.
But if you can create your way, make it, and prove or disprove it with all steps and best possible alternatives.

Operation:
Idea: We first estimate our level. On one of them, since we have coming back option or next to level . We go ahead of the problem and come back to the abyss along a different route.

### Answer & Explanation

Explanation:

Let's draw a tree to see if any condition is sufficient.

Veracity of the given statement's color should be blue

From the first statement, we can eliminate question mark & bold question mark.
But we can't assign a color.
Also question mark can't be True. Because if its false, then the statement can be true only when the question is False and NECessary True & Sufficient True.

From the second statement, we can eliminate red and green.
Here we still can't assign a color due to a question mark.

From the Set, we can check the conditions and conclude that the correct option should be A as either of the statement is sufficient.
Following this approach allows to many airs be added and make the set large.
Let's list the number of the statements in the Set and e.g. there is 3 with Min. A number of Statements which make it worst to split the second statement, (3) into parts.
If there is 10, then split 4, 4.
If there is 4, then split 1, 1, 1, 1.

====ABOUT TO QUERY LLM===
R:  
Suppose A's Name is XYZ whilst Nishant's and Arav's are NOT XYZ.
Statement 1 says they are brothers of Arav and Nishant being brothers and brothers of Arav, they are brothers of his mother. But this statement leaves out XYZ.
Statement 2 is insufficient as it takes you nowhere; Aravs mother and XYZs mother are sisters. OR Arav's mother and XYZ's mother are not sisters, they can be decent cousins of their mother or fathers.
Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are not sufficient as now A has 2 brothers - Arav (1) and Disa (2) and both not same as XYZ. Aravs mother is XYZ and Disa's mother is definitely NOT XYZ. And they have sisters who are in addition NOT XYZ, one is the mother of Arav and the other is the mother of Disa and none of them are the mother of XYZ.
Both statements taken together tell us Nishant, Arav and Disa are all the brothers of XYZ but we are clueless about their relations amongst themselves and their mother.
Statements 1 and 2 taken together make the Question questionable and in this case such questions are actually wrongly set as in this instance any of the possible relations amongst Nishant, Arav, XYZ and Disa turns out to weaken the case.
Although A cannot be anyone but XYZ and furthermore, Arav definitely belongs to the extended family of XYZ as we cannot infer anything beyond that. What difference between the description of XYZ's BROTHERS.
And Disa cannot belong to the family of XYZ as XYZ cannot be both a brother and a daughter at the same time. If Disa were a sister to XYZ, then XYZ's parents had to be a couple of children of which XYZ is one and Disa and the other and all their other children are either still born, one parent had to have died before having any children, any of them. Now, in either case the difference between the descriptions in the one statement and those in the other does not help one bit and once again both statements taken together do not suit the scenario.
Keep in mind that statements are followed by "Which of the following statements ...." So in any case we do not have to determine 'A is related to B', we only have to find out 'How is A related to B.' Since we know A and B and how related they are, the question then is not about B but fact finding question remains the same i.e. How related are they ?
The given statements are not UNIQUE.
Does it mean only ONE of them are correct?
Do we expect both the statements to be wrong?
Because two students, both in Nursing MCA 6 months apart, and 5 months apart within 1 year marked this as 'B' just as this official guide says.
In any case which of the following answer options fits the whole picture this question would be dismissable. One student says A and B are in the same school, another says CANNOT be in the same school and the third student says what remains unanswerable.
Already 600 VK post followers are mowed down.

Kavya, who is fifth from the left end that is 2 down(counting from 2 lateral side) from bottom and i.e. 8th from the top(As she is 7 on the right.) Which is in the 8th row 9 positions to the left side of down(counting left side) that is 8th persons to the left side of last/17th row.
i.e. all to the left side of the teacher
7th Person in the 9th row. As only from this position or this row my number comes 17,9+7
Aadesh’s number will be 16th row 8th Person, Which comes as
17,9+12th row 8th Person
Doesn’t satisfy in the following ways and is sufficient. Let us go for the second statement.
2.Statement 2

Identical line diagram for B, table formation is not needed as direct number statements are given and inputs of persons statements are lines,
Jagrav is 8th number from right side of Neerja, 2
Jagrav is 16th from right end, 3
Neerja is 5th from the left side of the board that is from 17th row, 3’ row 5
Putting 2 input we find that Jagrav is in 7th row and 14th position to the right side of front end. My writing is following the input and is liner coat of Jagrav’s calculation.
So 1,2,6,14
I.e. The left is 1 left of Teacher that is on left side. But this is calculated using 4th number input

2 position to right of Neerja means
That means I am 4 th person from 16th row 5th person which is 16 +4 +5=25 down counting of the students from top So Teacher is 17 right side and up side 1+2=3,5 row

<s>[INST]Kubera, the wealthy king of the Yakshas, liked all things made of gold and silver. The king decided to gift every Yaksha family a spherical globe made of solid gold with a cylindrical silver rod passing through its center. His goldsmith told him that this would require a 6 cm long, perfectly cylindrical hole to be bored through each perfectly spherical golden globe in order to insert the silver piece. Only the gold surrounding the curved surface of the silver cylinder would be retained. Kubera wanted the silver rod to be inserted but he was worried that gold was going to have to be removed from each of the globes. The goldsmith assured him that there would still be a fair bit of gold still left after the drilling.
What was the remaining volume of the golden globe, after drilling, when it was ready to be inserted with the silver rod?

Baskar and Sonali are students from a school of Delhi and they represented Indian School Quiz Team at the Asian Schools Quiz last week. Baskar lost and Sonali won the championship. Like this, East wins 2500 points, West earns 5000 and North gets 10000. After the championship, they discussed about how the rules are implemented in the final match.
“Baskar, I have a solution” began Sonali. “Whenever the West wound up their round instantly, I concluded their score to at least 5000 in my mind. Whenever a balky ripple along the way was encountered in the West team, it dawned on me that their score should not be as high as the 5000. This made it easy for me to track their score through the match. Furthermore, whenever ripple was encountered in the West and North teams, I immediately concluded that the West score should be 5000 and the North score should be 10000. With these checks, I could easily derive the West score as 5000 in the end.”
“Are you telling me that these checks could not have inferred me to a different level of confidence?” retorted Baskar, “Can you do me any different justice?”
“I hope some people behind me do not contest to the panel. I know they are far better says Baskar with a smile.

====ABOUT TO QUERY LLM===
R:  
In the beginning I thought to wrongly discard statement 2 (“P) as of no use, but then came to realize by elimination theory from the remaining statements that statement 2 is in fact sufficient – providing a strong belief that this is true. By saying “providing a strong belief” I mean to say that this statement by being sufficient is like subject matter; to say otherwise, Vighnesh might not like the music player <or video games>; then only one would be true, and two would be false if statement 1 is also sufficient (which also is proved later) and that statement 1 and 2 together will be sufficient only if both of those statements are sufficient (and that’s what I searched for).

Statement 1 alone is sufficient, thought not for the insufficiency but for when to be verified along with statement 2, to reach the sufficient conclusion.
We know that the person likes mathematics, and that the person likes to relax, and that he likes video games – all strong facts that imply that he likes programming and to increase the confidence further, I think that we associate it with only the favorite subject of mathematics possibility that besides mathematics, computer programming would be of his liking. So he likes programming. Statement for sufficient.

Statement 2
The person likes mathematics, but the rest of the statements are not enough. So after statement 1, that he likes programming, and now statement 2, he likes mathematics, then the condition in all cases addition between the two, is sweet. He likes programming and he likes mathematics. Answer of the question – yes it is.

Now the only combination of 1 and 2 together will conclude lower the question that the person likes mathematics and programming. Thus, makes answer of the question, “yes.”

Therefore, the correct template is that D is the correct answer, i.e. statements 1 and 2 are sufficient. Wasn’t that easy?
What is, meets C by rejecting P to provide further ease at the cost of fast information loss of that he likes mathematics. Is it set to be easy?

I also started with assuming max. two cases.
I noted, he likes programming.
I assumed,
case1: Will he like music player or video games?”
He did not appreciate the first statement.
For the second statement,
case2: Will he have other means of relaxing??
But when I found out that Vighnesh has a lot of things in his interest that I would have assumed for my belief, a lot later, that is in fact sufficient for his liking.
So these two facts were already sufficient enough.
But wanted to verify with statement 2, just in case it was to provide a degree of certainty.

1) X knows Y and X knows her book... This is not an event because there is only one X. So, there can be no two events.
2) Events are the \(X_n\), \(n=0\),1,2,3,..... So, \(X_nX_{n+1}\) are events: \(X\) knows \(Y\) and \(Y\) knows \(R\).

Answer: D

Statement 1 is sufficient bcoz if single tickets = 2343
might mean that athletes or people came as a family.............in such cases each individual ticket = 1 for family of 4

Statement 2 is sufficient simply because if stadium can sit 2600 people

If single tickets = 2343
So occupants of stadium = 2343 + 2600
= 4943

hi,
______________
Given - Fans went to the stadium
A - Number of single tickets sold
B - Stadium capacity

A Alone NOT sufficient, because we don't know whether tickets are individual or family/group package (2)

B Alone NOT sufficient

A & B together

A - single tickets sold = x
B - Stadium capacity = y

So let say 2 tickets registered for a single guest

Therefore, number of people = (x /2)
Also we know that number stays within the capacity of the stadium

So, number of people will lie between 0 and y.

So, Number of people going to Stadium = x/2

Good Liz r coming in the Upcoming month

A single ticket for a single person would imply that 2343 fans went to the stadium. So, A is sufficient

(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.

We do not know by principle how many tickets were bought for 1 person, and 2 persons.
So, B is insufficient

(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.

If we have both statement 1 and 2, we can find the number of the visitors

(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

Statements 1 and 2 are not consistent with one another.
I.e ) if we take statement 1, then we get one value
IF we take statement 2, then we get one value
IF we take both statements, then we get different value. So, combined statments 1&2 are not sufficient

So, the correct option is (D)

Option C: Neither A nor B alone is sufficient.

ONLY D is sufficient because we need both for the forward reasoning (5 pr to 25) and backwards reasoning number of people who came, we refer this wei need THIS NUMBER >2600 because the answer is Mensa

Statement 1

If
Let number of people = x
Then 2343 = 2x (say original tickets were sold by one each)
3x = 2343...........
so x =781

Now, say max = capacity of stadium , so (x+y) <= 2600 (also x=y)
So, 2x <= 2600

Therefore, x=2* (y/3+facility cost)/(x/3) result in Queues etc lead to a reduction in the number of people accommodated which cap size
Statements 1&2 taken together are sufficient.

Option (D)

Archit, Unable to analyse & understand the solution as given below
"merged some sims:
1. | In total, 2343_single-person_tickets were bought.
2. The stadium can seat _2600_fans.

There are minimum_2 tickets given to one family, and also at max_15 tickets can be given to a family, since there is no any given capacity of stadium, and also[…].

We are told that stadium has the capacity of 2600, then we can say that stadium must have Indoor and Outdoor seats, so people can be extra shifted to indoor at saturday.

So at maximum, if All tickets are given to families, we can guess that maximum number of fans gone to the stadium must be 2600 .

So, D is not Sufficient.

because Statement 1 and 2 are not consistent

Also if stadium gives only single person tickets, we can be sure that 2343 fans went to the stadium.

But on the other side, if stadium makes the condition that they are going to release maximum_only_ 15 tickets for a family. So, we can be sure of that only 39=15_max*2_people*5_tickets can enter on stadium for a single game.

So, 2343 does not lead to our desire answer in Statement 1.

Therefore, we can say that Statement 1 and 2 are not Sufficient."

SUFFICIENT.

Statement 2: The stadium can seat 2600 fans.

SMH, who made he stadium 500 smaller on the very next day?
Statement 2 doesn't tell us how many tickets were sold, so this makes the addition of two statements, unnecessary.

OPTION 2 SUFFICIENT.

ANSWER: D

Here what I think would also work. I am not even sure that 2600 ticket were sold because of statement 1 whereas I am sure that 3443 people went to stadium because of sold tickets from statement 1, hence,
"Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient

HI

I think D is another answer. See the statement:
Total single person tickets are sold.
I think it includes number of people in a family.
Hence answer is either 2343 or more.
As the stadium can seat only 2600 the number of people would be in between 2343 to 2600.

I Think B is correct

Statement 2
Single ticket required 2600 people to occupy entire stadium including empty seats. Possibility of tickets were given to more than one person in a family. Hence total number of people in stadium will be less than 2600.
whereas with statement 1 alone we can conclude that number of people in stadium is 2343. hence b is correct

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.

Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.

Conclude with which option is the correct one.

I see this absolutely wrong answer: my question is if you were to buy single tickets, in this case you have the same capacity that in other ones? in the amount of 2345 tickets, you envision that people can buy all of them just with singles? or are you taking in
also? are youed
the other hand, if you were to put a capacity of let's say a stadium of 500 people, can you buy an entire stadium just by singles? Please enlight me in this direction
Please answer with an attitude of "I teach not to school"

Daniel
I’d say “insufficient,” for both,
What about statement B?

Company A and B work together and sell products to everybody.
A. If alone: 2,000 peoples buy cocoa
B. If alone: they sell sweets for all 1,800 people
So if these 2,000+1,800 e.g. is the sum of the number of cocoa is sold and sweets e.g. capacity of 2,000 (A)+1,800(B)
INSUFFICIENT BOTH
Because what if peoples didn’t buy both cocoa and sweets and they only purchased one or the other?
If Aw alone: Aw sells 2k cocoa to 2k people first, only, then 1k to 1k people after
Same for Bw
THEN: 2,000+1,800 (Aw+Bw) > 2,000+1,800 (A+B) [In the question stem, assume that ONE buy one cocoa product and one buy one sweets (n) can be rewritten as say, A sells 4k all cocoa now to 4k peoples they all by the 1k plus as well then A sells 2k sweets to 2k peoples they are all planned to buy the 2k units of cocoa is sold as you must read NOT

Attached_Statement_1_2_Note.png

I think D. Look at the statement
As the capacity of stadium is 2600 single ticket and double ticket
Then lets say if 1000 single ticket sold then 2600 - 1000 =1600 double ticket bought ... So B single sold ticket is not necessary
Thus Non - Sufficient A & B
Now single ticket allowed to 2600 but statement I cannot fathom the direction of count
Regards Duff

Hi

I think this question must be solved this way:
The stadium can seat 2600 fans
2343 tickets were sold from that stadium
The stadium can seat 2600 people
2343 div 2 = 1170.5 is the least number of people.
2343 x 1.5 >2600
As the capacity of the stadium is adequate to contain such number of people
This stand meet consensus criteria in question stem let statement 1 itself be sufficient.
If you take statement 2 alone you are unable to ascertain the number of ticked sold as it does not contain how many people purchased the tickets with which ticket. The least number of people could prevented be less than 2343 and single ticket is not known.
Therefore statement 1 is sufficient
Kindly confirm if my thinking is correct

[INST]How many fans went to the stadium yesterday? Which of the following statements is/are sufficient to answer the previous question?
1. In total, 2343 single-person tickets were bought.
2.The stadium can seat 2600 fans.

The options are one of (A), (B), (C), (D), (E) as follows.
(A). Statement 1 alone is sufficient while statement 2 alone is insufficient.
(B). Statement 2 alone is sufficient while statement 1 alone is insufficient.
(C). Either statement 1 or statement 2 is sufficient.
(D). Statement 1 and statement 2 taken together are sufficient.
(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.

Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.

Conclude with which option is the correct one.

Answer: D

Statement 1 is sufficient bcoz if single tickets = 2343
might mean that athletes or people came as a family.............in such cases each individual ticket = 1 for family of 4

Statement 2 is sufficient simply because if stadium can sit 2600 people

If single tickets = 2343
So occupants of stadium = 2343 + 2600
= 4943

hi,
______________
Given - Fans went to the stadium
A - Number of single tickets sold
B - Stadium capacity

A Alone NOT sufficient, because we don't know whether tickets are individual or family/group package (2)

B Alone NOT sufficient

A & B together

A - single tickets sold = x
B - Stadium capacity = y

So let say 2 tickets registered for a single guest

Therefore, number of people = (x /2)
Also we know that number stays within the capacity of the stadium

So, number of people will lie between 0 and y.

So, Number of people going to Stadium = x/2

1. In total, 2343 single-person tickets were bought.
2.The stadium can seat 2600 fans.

If ticket is bought for two people then 1821 people went to the stadium. Also if n people went to the stadium say under the capacity of the stadium, then we have 1821 * n <= 2600, where 1821 = Number of ticket sold* (average number of people in the ticket)

(E). Neither statement 1 nor statement 2 nor statements 1 and 2 taken together is sufficient.

What is the correct option? Think step by step.

Give logic for and against each statement being sufficient.

Conclude with which option is the correct one.

I see this absolutely wrong answer: my question is if you were to buy single tickets, in this case you have the same capacity that in other ones? in the amount of 2345 tickets, you envision that people can buy all of them just with singles? or are you taking in
also? are youed
the other hand, if you were to put a capacity of let's say a stadium of 500 people, can you buy an entire stadium just by singles? Please enlight me in this direction
Please answer with an attitude of "I teach not to school"

I’d say “insufficient,” for both,
What about statement B?

Company A and B work together and sell products to everybody.
A. If alone: 2,000 peoples buy cocoa
B. If alone: they sell sweets for all 1,800 people
So if these 2,000+1,800 e.g. is the sum of the number of cocoa is sold and sweets e.g. capacity of 2,000 (A)+1,800(B)
INSUFFICIENT BOTH
Because what if peoples didn’t buy both cocoa and sweets and they only purchased one or the other?
If Aw alone: Aw sells 2k cocoa to 2k people first, only, then 1k to 1k people after
Same for Bw
THEN: 2,000+1,800 (Aw+Bw) > 2,000+1,800 (A+B) [In the question stem, assume that ONE buy one cocoa product and one buy one sweets (n) can be rewritten as say, A sells 4k all cocoa now to 4k peoples they all by the 1k plus as well then A sells 2k sweets to 2k peoples they are all planned to buy the 2k units of cocoa is sold as you must read NOT

Attached_Statement_1_2_Note.png

I think D. Look at the statement
As the capacity of stadium is 2600 single ticket and double ticket
Then lets say if 1000 single ticket sold then 2600 - 1000 =1600 double ticket bought ... So B single sold ticket is not necessary
Thus Non - Sufficient A & B
Now single ticket allowed to 2600 but statement I cannot fathom the direction of count
Regards Duff

Hi

I think this question must be solved this way:
The stadium can seat 2600 fans
2343 tickets were sold from that stadium
The stadium can seat 2600 people
2343 div 2 = 1170.5 is the least number of people.
2343 x 1.5 >2600
As the capacity of the stadium is adequate to contain such number of people
This stand meet consensus criteria in question stem let statement 1 itself be sufficient.
If you take statement 2 alone you are unable to ascertain the number of ticked sold as it does not contain how many people purchased the tickets with which ticket. The least number of people could prevented be less than 2343 and single ticket is not known.
Therefore statement 1 is sufficient
Kindly confirm if my thinking is correct

R:  INGRID has never ridden in a piston
engine aircraft or driven a station wagon. What can we infer?
conveniently[/INGRID]
Analysing the given stuff.
An aircraft is driven/moving. A wheelchair does not run/move on its own.
A wheelchair being propelled; it must be by somebody. A vessel carrying it, such as a car or a helicopter
A wheelchair is pushed/moved by somebody.
That person needs to physically push it. Thus, a muscle/manual effort.
How the wheelchair glides a road/route is of no concern. Nor someone
Equipped with a skilled extra appendage for riding/operating the machine
A toddler/child is to his toddler seat. A visible person is to his kitchen stool chair. A person wearing a cap is to his captain chair. A person on a bed is to his bed chair. A person on the floor of an aircraft is to his pilot chair, respectively. But a person in a wheelchair is? TO ITS FORK!!!
Above things are no concern of the person sitting in the chair.
They sit in the chair because of someone pushing them.
An electronic device can be used to control, such as a robot on a conveyor beltpushing a pile of something stuff on a warehouse. The robot does not use muscles!
A wheelchair being in its own force, as stated must be a thing of a different world or an imaginary world. It must be a big M machine to lift and push them by themselves.
People use legs to walk, use inches as a unit of measure, walking to compare two things standing one after the other type of relative positioning upon each other etc.
Movement happens/moving, this is so complex!
Automobile theft is common. But robots have no emotions and cannot be stolen. Easy consideration must be drawing, please.
Using a running dog has a sense in controlling a cart/gear as well.
Isn’t a unit of currencies used globally?
Steps and numbers are the two credentials to make a fast mover.
Rocks rolling down the mountain happen? Hell yeah! They overcome the strongest of the stubbornest of the things stopping them. You wreck a car once or twice and put it aside either for a wash or for scrapping.
Why the car can be a risk to human lives is because of the electricity, signals, radio meant for communication and similar devices. An electric car having extenuating virtues will have all the virtues of coal cars!
